Filter Data\\r\\nUser can easily filter the automatability report data by folder, feature and milestone. \\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## 6. New Prerequisites Management Page\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are introducing the **Prerequisites** page, a dedicated workspace to manage execution dependencies within your test sets. You can access this new page from the navigation bar under Testing > Deployments > Prerequisites.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Who is it for?**\\r\\nThis feature is designed for QA Engineers who manage complex automation workflows where the success of one test depends on the state or outcome of another.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Why is it useful?**\\r\\nAs test sets grow, tracking \\"which test runs after which\\" becomes difficult. This update eliminates the guesswork by providing a centralized, visual map of your test case hierarchy. It prevents execution failures caused by missing dependencies and allows for rapid, bulk updates to your test cases.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Key Highlights\\r\\n\\r\\n* **Dual-Perspective Visualization:**\\r\\n    * **Table View:** A detailed, searchable list with expandable rows that reveal the full \\"Prerequisite Chain\\" (upstream) and \\"Dependent Test Cases\\" (downstream).\\r\\n    * **Tree View:** A folder-like, indented structure that allows you to visualize your entire dependency hierarchy at a glance.\\r\\n\\r\\n* **Intelligent Search:** Instantly locate specific test sets or individual test cases by Name or ID to see exactly where they sit in the execution flow.\\r\\n* **Bulk Prerequisite Editing:** Select multiple test cases across either view and use the new **\\"Edit Prerequisite\\"** tool to reassign their parent dependency in a single action.\\r\\n* **Clear Dependency Status:** Quickly identify independent tests vs. those with requirements via the dedicated \\"Prerequisite\\" column.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Prerequisites Home:**\\r\\n\\r\\n![Prerequisites Home](image-12.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n**Table View:**\\r\\n\\r\\n![Table View](image-13.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n**Expanded Row in Table View:** \\r\\n\\r\\n![Expanded Row](image-14.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n**Tree View:**\\r\\n\\r\\n![Tree View](image-15.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n**Bulk Update Prerequisites for Selected Test Cases:** \\r\\n\\r\\n![Bulk Update](image-16.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n**View Prerequisite Chain for a Selected Test Case in the Tree View:**\\r\\n\\r\\n![Prerequisite Chain](image-17.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## 7. Test Case Import System (New)\\r\\n\\r\\nIntroduced a ZIP-based import system that creates test cases via GraphQL, resolves step conflicts, processes actions in bulk, stores attachments, and tracks progress with metadata.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Workflow\\r\\n\\r\\n**1. Upload Your File:**\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new landing page allows you to easily upload your ZIP file containing the test case data.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Upload File](image-18.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n**2. Conflict Resolution:**\\r\\n\\r\\nThe system automatically checks for any step conflicts. If no conflicts are found, it\'s ready to import.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Ready to Import](image-19.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n**3. Background Processing:**\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce the import is started, you\'ll receive a confirmation. The test cases are then processed in the background.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Import Started](image-20.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n**4. Import History & Status:**\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can monitor the progress and status of all your imports in the dedicated history view, showing whether they are completed or failed.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Import History](image-21.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## 8. Project Management Enhancements\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have significantly enhanced our project management capabilities, moving beyond beta to a fully realized ticket management system. This update focuses on reducing manual entry and providing better integration between internal and external workflows.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Key Features\\r\\n\\r\\n**1. Streamlined Ticket Creation:**\\r\\n\\r\\nFor new users or those creating a ticket in a new project, the system now provides a clean landing page with default selected values. This ensures that you can get started immediately without having to configure every field manually.\\r\\n\\r\\n![New Ticket Creation](image-22.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n**2. Modernized Edit Experience:**\\r\\n\\r\\nThe updated edit page utilizes our latest UI patterns and features the new **Link Component**. This allowed for a more organized overview of ticket details and related entities.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Ticket Edit Overview](image-23.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n**3. System Message Integration:**\\r\\n\\r\\nKeep track of title, folder, feature, version, milestone, etc. changes with automatic system messages. Any updates to the status are logged, providing a clear audit trail for the entire team.\\r\\n\\r\\n![System Messages](image-24.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n**4. Advanced Linking (GitHub & Jira):**\\r\\n\\r\\nIntegration is key! You can now link external GitHub and Jira tickets alongside your internal ZeuZ tickets, centralizing all project-related information in one place.\\r\\n\\r\\n![External Link Support](image-25.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n**5. Intelligent Link Creation:**\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen creating a new link, the system intelligently auto-populates relevant data from the edit pages. While these details can be edited before finalizing, the automation significantly reduces the effort required to connect related items.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Create Link Workflow](image-26.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n**6. Hover Information Popover:**\\r\\n\\r\\nWe\'ve added an intelligent popover for linked items. Hovering over a linked ticket ID instantly displays key information, allowing you to quickly cross-reference details without leaving your current view.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Link Info Popover](image-27.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n**7. Explore More Features:**\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we\u2019ve highlighted the major upgrades, there are many more features and refinements throughout the project management suite waiting to be discovered. We invite you to dive in, experiment with the new tools, and discover how these enhancements can transform your automation workflow."},{"id":"zeuz-platform-202512","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/zeuz-platform-202512","source":"@site/blog/2025-12-28-zeuz-platform-20251228/index.md","title":"ZeuZ Platform 202512","description":"Welcome to the December 2025 release of the ZeuZ platform!","date":"2025-12-28T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Changelog","permalink":"/blog/tags/changelog","description":"ZeuZ platform changelogs"}],"readingTime":6.71,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Mahmudul Alam","title":"Software Engineer","url":"https://github.com/mahbd","page":{"permalink":"/blog/authors/mahbd"},"socials":{"github":"https://github.com/mahbd","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mah20t/","x":"https://x.com/mahmudula2000"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/mahbd.png","key":"mahbd"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"zeuz-platform-202512","title":"ZeuZ Platform 202512","authors":["mahbd"],"tags":["changelog"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"ZeuZ Platform 202602","permalink":"/blog/zeuz-platform-202602"},"nextItem":{"title":"ZeuZ Platform 202511","permalink":"/blog/zeuz-platform-202511"}},"content":"Welcome to the December 2025 release of the ZeuZ platform!\\r\\n\\r\\n## \ud83d\ude80 New Features\\r\\n\\r\\nThis release focuses mainly on bug fixes and stability with a few small features.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. **Improved Runtime Parameter Create/Edit Modal**: Removed tag icon for editable tag name, modal resizing, and consistent styling.\\r\\n2. **Multi Device Support**: Support for multiple devices in mobile inspector and switching between them.\\r\\n3. **Fresh New Look for Presets**: Modernized UI, search bar, and improved responsiveness.\\r\\n4. **Enhancement of Integrated Installer**: Node-level and category-level status checks and installations, system monitoring, and simulator management.\\r\\n5. **Milestone Page Redesign**: Cleaner experience, dedicated discussion threads, and improved visibility.\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n## 1. Improved Runtime Parameter Create/Edit Modal\\r\\nOur previous implementation had some inconvenience like user had to click the tag icon to edit tag. This is now fixed. You can now click on tag name to edit it. As soon as you click on the tag name an input field will appear.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Removed tag icon. Instead it shows editable tag name.\\r\\n2. Modal size changes based on tag and value length\\r\\n3. Same background styling added in debug page too\\r\\n\\r\\n![image-1](image-1.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n## 2. Multi Device Support\\r\\n\\r\\nPreviously only one device was allowed in mobile inspector. It was not possible to switch between two devices. Now user can use multiple devices to run test and switch between them.\\r\\n\\r\\n![image](image-2.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n## 3. Fresh New Look for Presets\\r\\n\\r\\nWe\u2019ve given the Presets page (also known as Run/CI Presets) a complete makeover. While you\u2019ll find all the familiar tools you rely on to manage your presets, the entire experience has been rebuilt to be quicker, cleaner, and more intuitive.\\r\\n\\r\\n### What\u2019s New:\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Modernized UI**: Enjoy a sleek \\"Preset List\\" design that enhances the card-based interface and reduces visual clutter.\\r\\n- **Search Bar**: Finding the right preset is now instant. We\u2019ve added a dedicated search bar at the top of the page so you can filter through your list by title in real-time.\\r\\n- **Improved Responsiveness**: The redesigned components offer a snappier feel and better consistency across different screen sizes.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Screenshot - full page:\\r\\n![Image](image-3.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Screenshot - single card expanded:\\r\\n![Image](image-4.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n### \\r\\nEverything you used in the previous version is still there, just presented in a much more polished design.\\r\\n\\r\\n## 4. Enhancement of Integrated Installer\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this release, we added new features in out intergrated installer to give the user more smooth exprience while setting up required tools and dependencies. With this enhancement, user can easily install all the items unders a single category with just one click, check the tools status with just one click and monitor important system information. \\r\\n\\r\\n### Node-level status check option\\r\\n\\r\\nNow users can check the status of all the tools of a node - which tools are installed and not installed by just clicking the \\"check all\\" button under the node name.  This feature eliminates the need to check the status of each tool/dependency one by one. \\r\\n\\r\\n![Image](image-5.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Category-level install option\\r\\n\\r\\nWith this feature, users can install all the tools unders a category at once. For example, under the andorid category there is Nodejs, Appium, Java, Android sdk and Adb. User only need to just click the \\"install all\\" button beside the \\"Android\\" category name, and it will install all the tools under the \\"Android\\" cateogory. \\r\\n\\r\\n![Image](image-6.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Category-level status check option\\r\\n\\r\\nAlongside with the node-level status check option, user can also check the status of the tools unders a category by clickng the \\"check all\\" button beside the cateogory name. \\r\\n\\r\\n![Image](image-7.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Monitor system information\\r\\n\\r\\nWith this feature, users can constantly monitor important system information of the machine that a node is currently running. This feature provide the user important system information such as - \\r\\n\\r\\n- Ram usage\\r\\n- Cpu usage\\r\\n- Total RAM\\r\\n- Total CPU\\r\\n-  OS details (e.g. OS name, version)\\r\\n- CPU details (e.g. CPU cores, CPU architecture)\\r\\n- Memory details (e.g. total RAM, free RAM)\\r\\n- Disk details (e.g. free disk space, mount points)\\r\\n\\r\\nThis feature provides the user dynamic information so that users can constantly monitor RAM usage, CPU usage and other important details that changes frequently.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Image](image-8.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Install and launch Android Virtual Devices\\r\\n\\r\\nThis feature enables the user to install their preferred android virtual device and launch them directly from the integrated-installer. Under the \\"AndroidEmulator\\" category, users can find a list of already installed android virtual device. And by clicking the \\"install\\" button beside the \\"AndroidEmulator\\" category name, it will show the list of available android virtual devices that the user can install. \\r\\n\\r\\n![Image](image-9.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n![Image](image-10.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n![Image](image-11.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Install and launch iOSSimulator\\r\\n\\r\\nSimiliar to Android virtual devices, users can install and launch iOSSimulator through this feature. Under the \\"iOSSimulator\\"  category a list of installed iOSSimulator will appear. These simulators can be launch by clicking the launch button. Also, users can delete the simulators using the delete button beside it. A list of avaiable simulators users can install will appear by clicking the \\"install\\" button beside the \\"iOSSimualtor\\" category .\\r\\n\\r\\n![Image](image-12.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n![Image](image-13.webp)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Walk through\\r\\n\\r\\nHere is a walk through video of the node-installer feature - \\r\\n\\r\\n<video controls loop>\\r\\n  <source src=\\"/blog/zeuz-platform-202512/video-1.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\r\\n</video>\\r\\n\\r\\n## 5. Milestone Page Redesign & Extended Functionality\\r\\nThe Milestone page has been redesigned for a cleaner, more modern experience, with enhanced visibility and usability:\\r\\n- Users can now start dedicated discussion threads on specific milestones.\\r\\n- Each milestone card displays high-level progress information without needing to open details.\\r\\n- Linked items are displayed in a modal view with appropriate icons and tooltips for better clarity.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Image](image-14.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n![Image](image-15.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## \ud83d\udc1b Bug Fixes\\r\\n\\r\\n1. In set page, the last run was determined by the id. Sometimes id doesn\'t maintain sequence and having wrong data of test run status. Now we are ordering by last_run_date.\\r\\n2. In Run Test page when no set was selected and user tries to create preset it should focus on search field to acknowledge user. This has been fixed.\\r\\n3. Data Store was not allowing empty file upload. Also there proper error message were missing. \\r\\n4. Presets page used to show milestone IDs (numbers) instead of milestone names, in the new design this is fixed.\\r\\n5. When actions are restored from a previous step version, the disabled actions were getting enabled - The issue is fixed.\\r\\n6. **Isolated GQL filtering for test cases by team/project:** Test case titles were previously treated globally, resulting in duplicate-title conflicts. Filtering is now isolated by team/project, so different teams or projects can use the same test case title without issues.\\r\\n7. **Folder/Feature filter now supports numeric values:** Numeric inputs were not accepted previously. The GQL filter now correctly recognizes and processes numbers.\\r\\n8.  **New Test Case creation no longer removes duplicate steps:** When creating a test case via the New TC Create page, identical steps were being de-duplicated automatically. GQL now preserves the full list exactly as selected, even if multiple identical steps are added intentionally.\\r\\n9. **Discussion mention autocomplete behavior corrected:** Pressing Enter while an autosuggestion was highlighted used to send the message instead of completing the mention. Now, pressing Enter correctly autocompletes the suggestion without sending the message.\\r\\n10. **Removed 3-digit Test Case ID validation on Debug page:** The Debug page previously enforced a three-digit test case ID format. This validation has been removed to support broader ID formats.\\r\\n11. **External Webhook Notification**: Failed breakdown webhook notifications were not sent in some cases when more than 15 test cases existed. Fixed the issue.\\r\\n12. **Import test case Bug**: Step imported with no actions issue is fixed.\\r\\n\\r\\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Improvements\\r\\n1. **System messages for Discussion participant changes:** Adding or removing participants from a discussion is now logged automatically as a system message.

New Test Case Create Page\\r\\n\\r\\n## Overview\\r\\nThe Test Case Create Page has received a major update. The redesigned UI is more polished, user-friendly, and intuitive. You can now switch between two modes: the improved **Simple Mode** and the new **zAI Mode**.  \\r\\n**zAI Mode** is an AI-powered test-case creation workflow, simply describe the scenario you want to automate, and zAI will generate a complete test case for you. You only need to review and add actions; no additional manual setup is required.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn **Simple Mode**, you can define steps before creating the test case. You can also view the most frequently used global steps, add them instantly, search for specific steps, or create new ones with a single click, all before finalizing the test case.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## \ud83c\udfaf zAI Mode Highlights\\r\\n- Provide a prompt describing your scenario, and zAI will generate multiple test cases for you to choose from.\\r\\n- zAI suggests everything required for a complete test case.\\r\\n- You can attach multiple test cases as references; zAI will analyze them thoroughly.\\r\\n- You can upload text-based files to give zAI more context about your scenario.\\r\\n- zAI analyzes only the test cases you select.\\r\\n- Automatically selects the most appropriate folder and feature from your list.\\r\\n- Clean, minimalistic, and streamlined UI.\\r\\n\\r\\n![zAI-1](zAI-1.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n![zAI-2](zAI-2.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n![zAI-3](zAI-3.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n## \ud83d\udd0d Simple Mode Highlights\\r\\n- New, clean, and simplified UI design.\\r\\n- Updated component styling.\\r\\n- Add steps before creating the test case.\\r\\n- View the top 10 most-used global steps.\\r\\n- Search and add any global step.\\r\\n- Create new steps with just one click.\\r\\n\\r\\n![simple-mood-highlight](simple-mood-highlight.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n# 2. Inbox & zAI Chat\\r\\n\\r\\n## Overview\\r\\nWe have introduced a new universal chat feature in ZeuZ. It works similarly to modern chat platforms, offering a clean and simple interface for direct messages or group conversations. The chat supports markdown and user mentions. Our zAI page assistant is now more intelligent & has new look, Chat history & Multiple thread management.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Inbox Highlights\\r\\n- Start group chats or direct messages between two people.\\r\\n- Read/unread message tracking.\\r\\n- Infinite scroll for Chats, Users, and Threads.\\r\\n- Mention any member in a group.\\r\\n- Reply to messages.\\r\\n- Edit your own messages.\\r\\n- Delete your messages.\\r\\n- Draggable chat button.\\r\\n- Unread message count badge.\\r\\n- Search for specific users, groups, or threads.\\r\\n\\r\\n![chat-1](chat-1.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n![chat-2](chat-2.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n![chat-3](chat-3.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n![chat-4](chat-4.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## zAI Page Assist\\r\\n- Improved accuracy and helpfulness in answering queries.\\r\\n- Chat history is now saved.\\r\\n- Support for multiple chats with management features.\\r\\n- Redesigned and polished UI.\\r\\n- Delete threads and edit thread titles.\\r\\n- Smooth, visually enhanced animations.\\r\\n\\r\\n![page-assist-1](page-assist-1.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n![page-assist-2](page-assist-2.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n![page-assist-3](page-assist-3.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n# 3. Redesign of Runtime Parameter Component\\r\\n\\r\\n## Overview\\r\\nThe Runtime Parameter is one of the most used features of ZeuZ. So we took time to make it look simpler, made its usage more straightforward, and removed confusing parts. We also rethought the copy and paste process. Now users have more control over what they are copying and what happens when pasting.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n### New Design\\r\\n\\r\\n![run-time-parameter1](run-time-parameter1.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nWe added background colors to each Runtime Parameter to make them easily distinguishable. We also rethought the color scheme so users can understand everything at a glance. When no value is selected, it stays grayed out; when a value is selected, it becomes darker to indicate that a selection has been made. There is also a green/gray dot for extra clarity.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy default, the value appears as plain text, making it easy on the eyes. When clicked, it converts into a select component and allows the user to change the value.\\r\\n\\r\\n![run-time-parameter2](run-time-parameter2.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe editing and creation UI for Runtime Parameters has also been updated. It now shows a modal for isolation and easier use. We now set the tag automatically to simplify the process. If the user wishes, they can click the tag icon to set a custom value to make it easier to remember.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Copy & Paste\\r\\n\\r\\n![copy-run-time-parameter](copy-run-time-parameter.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nPreviously, we only allowed users to copy the entire Runtime Parameter component. Now, we allow users to choose what to copy. This lets users skip unnecessary Runtime Parameter components when copying.\\r\\n\\r\\nPasting is also improved. If there is any conflicting value with the same name and tag, a modal will appear allowing the user to rename the tag. They can also replace the existing value by keeping the same tag name.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Bug Fix\\r\\n- Fixed a bug where selected configurations were not being saved.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n# 4. Improved Private Key Sharing for ZeuZ Secret\\r\\n\\r\\n## Overview\\r\\nManaging private keys in previous versions of ZeuZ Secret was difficult and time-consuming. Users had to manually access each node to add a secret key, which created a significant challenge\u2014especially for non-technical users. To solve this, we introduced a streamlined, web-based workflow to **generate**, **share** private keys directly from the ZeuZ interface.\\r\\n\\r\\n![improve-private-key](improve-private-key.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Generate Private Key\\r\\nYou can now generate a private key directly from the browser without needing to log in to any node.  \\r\\nAfter generating the key, you\'ll be prompted to select the nodes where the new private key should be stored. ZeuZ will automatically send the key to the selected nodes, removing the hassle of manual setup.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Share Existing Private Key\\r\\n\\r\\n![generate-private-key](generate-private-key.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a private key already exists on a specific node, you can share it with other nodes directly from the web interface.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Select the node that contains the existing private key.  \\r\\n2. Choose the nodes where you want that key to be copied.  \\r\\n3. A secure request will be sent to the source node.  \\r\\n4. The node encrypts the private key and sends it to the **zsvc**.  \\r\\n5. The **zsvc** then delivers the encrypted key to the target nodes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis process ensures the key never leaves the system unencrypted and simplifies multi-node synchronization.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Allowed Nodes Control\\r\\nWe also introduced an **Allowed Nodes** feature.  \\r\\nThis lets you specify which nodes are permitted to use a particular secret value. It adds an extra layer of security by limiting access only to trusted nodes.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n# 5. Redesign of Project Management (Beta Release)\\r\\n\\r\\n## Overview\\r\\nWe are introducing a new, simplified UI for all project item types\u2014**Requirement, Task, Bug, and Document**. This redesign focuses on readability, consistency, and a smoother workflow across all pages.\\r\\nThis update is currently in **Beta** and still **a work in progress**.\\r\\n\\r\\n![new-create-page](new-create-page.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n![new-edit-page](new-edit-page.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Unified Layout Across All Item Types\\r\\n\\r\\nAll items now share the same clean structure:\\r\\n\\r\\n### Left Side\\r\\n- **Description** directly under the title\\r\\n- **Discussion** section below the description\\r\\n- Streamlined content area with improved spacing and typography\\r\\n\\r\\n### Middle and Right Side\\r\\n- Item metadata neatly grouped, including:\\r\\n  * Status\\r\\n  * Owner\\r\\n  * Milestone\\r\\n  * Version (if applicable)\\r\\n  * Feature/Module\\r\\n  * Priority\\r\\n  * Visibility (Public/Private)\\r\\n  * Rejection/Testing indicators\\r\\n  * Tags/Labels\\r\\n  * Time estimates (for Task/Bug)\\r\\n  * Follow\\r\\n  * Attachment\\r\\n- All indicators shown as simplified badges for quick scanning\\r\\n\\r\\n## Cleaner & More Modern Visual Design\\r\\n- Softer backgrounds\\r\\n- More whitespace and improved alignment\\r\\n- Consistent icons and badge styles\\r\\n- Clearer visual hierarchy for titles, metadata, and discussion threads\\r\\n- Better long-text readability in descriptions\\r\\n\\r\\n## Improved Usability\\r\\n- Faster navigation through simplified page layout\\r\\n- Reduced clutter from the old UI\\r\\n- Metadata is easier to find and scan\\r\\n- Works consistently across Requirement, Task, Bug, and Document pages\\r\\n\\r\\n## Work-in-Progress Notes\\r\\n- This is a **Beta version**\\r\\n- Additional refinements, interactions, and UI polish will follow\\r\\n- We are collecting feedback to improve the experience further\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n# 6. Introducing the Integrated Installer\\r\\n\\r\\n## Overview\\r\\nWe are introducing a significant update to our core platform installer, designed to transform your test environment setup from hours of manual configuration into a seamless, single-window experience. This new feature, the Integrated Installer, allows you to **one-click install**, manage, and verify many essential development tools and prerequisites directly within the application, drastically reducing the effort traditionally spent on downloading, setting up environment variables, and running terminal commands.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis update provides integrated installation and status checking for all major test dependencies. For Mobile Automation, you can now install key components like **Android SDK, Java/JDK, ADB, Node.js, and Appium**. This includes a streamlined workflow for installing and launching **Android Emulators** directly. For Database and Web Testing, we have added support for popular database connectors (for **PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, and Oracle**), as well as dedicated browser support for **Chrome for Testing, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge**.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo ensure a smooth setup, we\'ve implemented several quality-of-life enhancements. The installer now automatically checks to make sure you have all the necessary components before starting an installation, guiding you if anything is missing. If an installation fails, you\'ll see a clear \\"View Error\\" button to quickly understand what went wrong. Finally, when the system needs administrator rights (like a sudo password) to install certain services, a secure, built-in window will handle the authorization, making the whole setup process simpler and more secure. All these ensure that you can manage all the pre-requisites and dependencies without ever having to leave the web interface.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Integrated Installer page\\r\\n\\r\\n![node-installer](node-installer.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Checking status of an item\\r\\n\\r\\n![node-installer-check-status](node-installer-check-status.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Installing an item\\r\\n\\r\\n![node-installer-install](node-installer-install.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Machine Password prompt\\r\\n\\r\\n![node-installer-password-prompt](node-installer-password-prompt.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n# 7. Prevented ZeuZ Node Getting stuck\\r\\n\\r\\n## Overview\\r\\n\\r\\nPreviously, sometimes a running node becomes undeployable even though the node appears online. This issue has been addressed in this release. Now, nodes that are online will not become undeployable.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n# 8. Groups\\r\\n\\r\\n## Overview\\r\\nGroups provide a comprehensive group-based permission system that enables centralized access control and flexible permission management across the ZeuZ platform. This feature makes it easy to assign consistent permissions to multiple users, ensuring secure testing operations, controlled execution rights, and organized project access.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Why it matters / Use Cases\\r\\n- **Centralized access control**: Groups make it easy to assign consistent permissions to multiple users.\\r\\n- **Secure testing operations**: They restrict who can view, edit, run, or deploy test cases.\\r\\n- **Controlled execution rights**: Only authorized members can manage executions and runtime parameters.\\r\\n- **Organized project access**: Groups control access to backlog, tasks, sprints, and documents.\\r\\n- **Filtered reporting access**: They ensure that only selected users can view specific reports.\\r\\n- **Protected configuration settings**: Groups prevent unauthorized changes to dashboards, views, or settings.\\r\\n- **Faster onboarding**: New users automatically receive correct permissions when added to a group.\\r\\n- **Improved security compliance**: Groups limit access to sensitive actions like admin-level options or deployment controls.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Prerequisites\\r\\n- Access to ZeuZ Server with permissions for **Admin \u2192 Group Policy \u2192 Groups**.\\r\\n- The user must be able to open the Policy Editor to create or modify groups.\\r\\n- The user must have sufficient rights to create a new role, edit an existing role, or view available roles.\\r\\n- Users should already exist in the system so they can be assigned to the group through the Assign Users option.\\r\\n- Teams must know which actions (view or edit) each role in the group should have before configuring the toggles.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Quick-Start\\r\\n1. **Open the Policy Editor**: Navigate to the Policy Editor to view and manage permission policies.\\r\\n2. **Select a Role**: Choose a role from the list on the left, such as *New group*, *Super Admin Group*, or *Default Group*.\\r\\n3. **Review Permissions**: View the permissions assigned to the selected role under sections such as Testing, Create/Edit, and Search.\\r\\n4. **Modify Permissions**: Toggle the *View* or *Edit* options to adjust the permissions for each action.\\r\\n5. **Save Changes**: Click *Save Changes* to apply the updated permission settings.\\r\\n6. **Assign Users**: Use the *Assign Users* button to add or remove users from the selected role.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Permission Resolution Logic\\r\\n\\r\\n### The Union Rule (Additive OR Logic)\\r\\nUsers can belong to multiple Groups simultaneously. The system uses an **additive (OR logic)** approach to resolve permissions when a user is a member of multiple groups.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Core Principle\\r\\n> **If any single group grants a specific permission to a user, the user has that permission, even if their other groups do not have it.**\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Global Scope\\r\\nPermissions are **not project-specific**. If a permission (e.g., \\"Deploy Test Case\\") is removed from a Group, that capability is revoked for all Team Projects associated with that Group\'s context.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Example Scenario: \\"Deploy Test Case\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n**User**: John Doe\\r\\n\\r\\n|  Group Membership  |  Permission Status  |  Can Deploy?  |\\r\\n|--------------------|---------------------|---------------|\\r\\n|  Group A           |  OFF                |  \u274c No       |\\r\\n|  Group B           |  OFF                |  \u274c No       |\\r\\n|  Group C           |  ON                 |  \u2705 Yes      |\\r\\n\\r\\n**Result**: John Doe **CAN** Deploy Test Cases.\\r\\n\\r\\n> **Important Note**: A restriction in one group does not override a grant in another. To revoke access entirely, the user must be removed from all groups that grant that specific permission.\\r\\n\\r\\n### System Admin Group\\r\\nThe **System Admin Group** is the highest-privileged group in the ecosystem, equivalent to \\"Super Admin\\" level.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Membership\\r\\nContains all System Administrators.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Capabilities\\r\\n1. **User Management**: Can add other users to the System Admin Group.\\r\\n2. **Full System Access**: Has full access to all system features by default.\\r\\n3. **Exclusive Privilege**: Can view and edit the \\"Admin Menu Visibility\\" toggle for other groups.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Key Features\\r\\n\\r\\n### Policy Editor Section\\r\\n- On the left side, the **Policy Editor** panel lists existing roles. One example, \\"New Group\\", is visible with *76 permissions* assigned.\\r\\n- The **Create Role +** button is available on the right side of the Policy Editor.\\r\\n- A modal window titled **Create New Role** is displayed at the center of the screen.\\r\\n- The form includes a mandatory field labeled **Role Name**, where the user is expected to type the name of the new role.\\r\\n- Two action buttons are provided:  \\r\\n  - **Cancel**: Closes the popup without creating the role.\\r\\n  - **Create Role**: Confirms the creation of the new role once a valid name is entered.\\r\\n\\r\\n![policy-editor-1](policy-editor-1.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n![policy-editor-2](policy-editor-2.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Edit / Delete Roles\\r\\n- The label **Editing** indicates that the user is working on the details or configuration of the selected role.\\r\\n- The role\'s name, **New group**, is displayed beside the label for quick identification.\\r\\n- Two action buttons appear on the right side:  \\r\\n  - **Edit**: Allows the user to modify the role\'s name or settings.\\r\\n  - **Delete**: It is highlighted in red to signal a critical action, as it is used to permanently delete the role.\\r\\n- A text field is provided containing the updated role name, **New group edit**.\\r\\n- On the right side, a **Save** button is available, which the user must click to confirm and store the changes. This layout allows users to modify a role\'s name and save the updated information within the system.\\r\\n\\r\\n![edit-role-1](edit-role-1.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n![edit-role-2](edit-role-2.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Assign Users\\r\\n- The **Assign Users** function is used to link specific users to a particular group or role. In simple terms, it allows an administrator to decide which users should belong to the selected group, so they can receive the permissions, access levels, or restrictions defined for that group.\\r\\n- After clicking the **Assign Users** button, the following elements become available.:  \\r\\n  - **Header and Summary**:  \\r\\n    - **Assign Users to Group**: This is the main title of the page.\\r\\n    - **4 users assigned**: A summary stating that this specific group currently has 4 members.\\r\\n    - **None, Developer, Member**: These are likely filters or status indicators for the users, allowing an admin to view users with specific roles (e.g., *Developer*) or no role (*None*).\\r\\n  - **Add New User Section**: This is the control panel for adding more people to the group.\\r\\n    - **Select users**: This is a button or a dropdown menu that, when clicked, would open a list of all available users in the system to choose from and add to this group.\\r\\n  - **Assigned Users Section**: This is a list that displays all the users who are currently members of the group. It has several components:  \\r\\n    - **Manage users currently assigned to this group**: A sub-heading explaining the purpose of this list.\\r\\n    - **User List**: A table or list showing the assigned users.\\r\\n    - **Search Bar**: An admin can use the search box, labeled **Search users by name or role...**, to filter the list and quickly locate a specific user.\\r\\n    - **Actions**: Each user has a **Remove** button next to their name. Clicking this would remove that specific user from the group.\\r\\n    - **Pagination Info**:  The text **1-4 of 4 users** and **10 / page** indicates that all 4 users are shown on this first page, and the interface can display up to 10 users per page.\\r\\n- After clicking the **Save Changes** button, the **Group \\"New group\\" updated successfully** message appears.\\r\\n\\r\\n![assign-user-1](assign-user-1.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n![assign-user-2](assign-user-2.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n![assign-user-3](assign-user-3.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Show Permissions\\r\\n- The **Show Permissions** function displays the exact access rights granted to a selected group. It allows administrators to review which actions can be performed.\\r\\n- After clicking the **Show Permissions** option, all features available under the Testing, Project and Admin for that specific group are displayed. Features that the group can access are indicated by a purple button, while features that are not accessible are shown with a grey button.\\r\\n\\r\\n![show-permission-1](show-permission-1.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n![show-permission-2](show-permission-2.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Grant All / Remove All\\r\\n- **Grant All**: The **Grant All** function is used to give a group or user full access to all available features or permissions at once. Instead of enabling each permission individually, this option automatically selects all permissions, simplifying the process of assigning comprehensive access.\\r\\n- **Remove All**: The **Remove All** function is used to revoke all permissions or access rights from a group or user at once. Instead of deselecting each permission individually, this option clears all assigned permissions, effectively removing access to all features."},{"id":"zeuz-platform-20251015","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/zeuz-platform-20251015","source":"@site/blog/2025-10-15-zeuz-platform-20251015/index.md","title":"ZeuZ Platform 20251015","description":"Welcome to the October 2025 release of the ZeuZ platform!","date":"2025-10-15T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Changelog","permalink":"/blog/tags/changelog","description":"ZeuZ platform changelogs"}],"readingTime":8.53,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Muntasib Muhib Chowdhury","title":"Product Engineer","url":"https://github.com/Muntasib-creator","page":{"permalink":"/blog/authors/muhib"},"socials":{"x":"https://x.com/MuntasibC","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/muhib-c/","github":"https://github.com/Muntasib-creator"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/Muntasib-creator.png","key":"muhib"},{"name":"Tanvir Hossain Antu","title":"Product Engineer","url":"https://github.com/Antu7","page":{"permalink":"/blog/authors/antu"},"socials":{"x":"https://x.com/antu_tanvir","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/antu7/","github":"https://github.com/antu7","newsletter":"https://antu7.github.io"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/Antu7.png","key":"antu"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"zeuz-platform-20251015","title":"ZeuZ Platform 20251015","authors":["muhib","antu"],"tags":["changelog"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"ZeuZ Platform 202511","permalink":"/blog/zeuz-platform-202511"},"nextItem":{"title":"ZeuZ Platform 20250909","permalink":"/blog/zeuz-platform-20250909"}},"content":"Welcome to the October 2025 release of the ZeuZ platform!\\r\\n\\r\\n## \ud83d\ude80 New Features\\r\\n\\r\\nThis release introduces three major new features that significantly enhance security, access control, and data management in ZeuZ:\\r\\n\\r\\n1.

Enhanced Group Permissions & History Management\\r\\n\\r\\n## Overview\\r\\nWe\'re excited to announce three powerful new features that significantly enhance user access control and visibility management in the Zeuz platform. These features provide granular permission control, improved history page customization, and intelligent test case visibility filtering.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## \ud83c\udfaf Sub-feature 1: Group Permission System\\r\\n\\r\\n![groups-nav](groups-nav.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n### What\'s New\\r\\nIntroducing a comprehensive group-based permission system that allows administrators to create custom user groups with specific access rights across the entire platform.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Key Capabilities\\r\\n- **Flexible Group Management**: Create and manage user groups with custom permissions\\r\\n- **Granular Access Control**: Assign specific permissions for different platform modules\\r\\n- **Role-Based Security**: Control access to testing, project management, and administrative functions\\r\\n- **Easy User Assignment**: Add users to groups with automatic permission inheritance\\r\\n- **\ud83d\udd04 Permission Union Logic**: Users get **combined permissions** from ALL their groups - if ANY group has a permission, the user gets access\\r\\n\\r\\n### Permission Union Example\\r\\n```\\r\\nUser belongs to: Group 1, Group 2, Group 3\\r\\n\\r\\nGroup 1: \u2705 Can view Set page\\r\\nGroup 2: \u274c Cannot view Set page  \\r\\nGroup 3: \u274c Cannot view Set page\\r\\n\\r\\nResult: \u2705 User CAN view Set page (because Group 1 has permission)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Benefits\\r\\n- **Enhanced Security**: Fine-grained control over who can access what\\r\\n- **Simplified Management**: Centralized permission management through groups\\r\\n- **Flexible Access**: Users can have different permissions through different group memberships\\r\\n- **Scalable Architecture**: Easy to add new permissions and groups as needed\\r\\n- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing users automatically get full access through default group\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\nThis permission union logic is particularly powerful because:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. **Flexible Role Assignment**: Users can be in multiple groups with different purposes\\r\\n2. **Cumulative Permissions**: No need to duplicate permissions across groups\\r\\n3. **Easy Management**: Add users to groups without worrying about permission conflicts\\r\\n4. **Granular Control**: Fine-tune access by adding/removing users from specific groups\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example:\\r\\n- **Group A**: Test Engineers (can view test cases, run tests)\\r\\n- **Group B**: Project Managers (can view reports, manage milestones)  \\r\\n- **Group C**: Administrators (can manage users, system settings)\\r\\n\\r\\nA user in both Group A and Group B would have permissions from both groups, allowing them to view test cases AND reports, but not administrative functions unless they\'re also in Group C.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis makes the permission system very flexible and user-friendly while maintaining security!\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## \ud83d\udd0d Sub-feature 2: Micro-Level Permission Control on History Page\\r\\n\\r\\n![access-restricted](access-restricted.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n### What\'s New\\r\\nTransform your history page experience with granular visibility controls that let you customize exactly what information users can see on deployment history cards.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Customizable History Elements\\r\\nUsers can now control visibility of these history page elements:\\r\\n- **Run ID** \u2192 View\\r\\n- **Node ID** \u2192 View  \\r\\n- **Milestone** \u2192 View\\r\\n- **Objective** \u2192 View\\r\\n- **Version** \u2192 View\\r\\n- **Tester** \u2192 View\\r\\n- **Deployment Time** \u2192 View\\r\\n- **Duration** \u2192 View\\r\\n- **Storage** \u2192 View\\r\\n- **Details** \u2192 View\\r\\n- **Runtime Parameters/Details** \u2192 View\\r\\n- **Test Case** \u2192 View\\r\\n- **Test Case Type** \u2192 View\\r\\n- **Browser** \u2192 View\\r\\n- **Testcase Log** \u2192 View\\r\\n- **Circle Graph** \u2192 View\\r\\n- **Status** \u2192 View\\r\\n\\r\\n### How It Works\\r\\n- **Group-Based Control**: Permissions are managed at the group level\\r\\n- **Toggle Interface**: Easy-to-use toggle switches for each element\\r\\n- **Real-Time Updates**: Changes apply immediately to user views\\r\\n- **Permission Inheritance**: Users inherit permissions from their assigned groups\\r\\n\\r\\n### Benefits\\r\\n- **Cleaner Interface**: Hide irrelevant information to reduce clutter\\r\\n- **Role-Appropriate Views**: Show only relevant data based on user roles\\r\\n- **Improved Focus**: Users see only what they need for their specific tasks\\r\\n- **Enhanced Security**: Sensitive information can be hidden from unauthorized users\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## \ud83c\udfaf Sub-feature 3: Deploy Page Testcase Visibility Control\\r\\n\\r\\n![group-in-runtest](group-in-runtest.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n### What\'s New\\r\\nIntelligent test case visibility filtering that ensures users only see deployment history for test cases they\'re authorized to view, with special handling for automated deployments.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Key Functionality\\r\\n- **Group-Based Visibility**: Only users in assigned groups can see specific test case deployments\\r\\n- **Scheduler Deployment Filtering**: Automated scheduler deployments are hidden from general history view\\r\\n- **Direct Access Preservation**: Users can still access test cases via direct links even if not visible in history\\r\\n- **Smart Filtering**: System automatically filters history based on user group memberships\\r\\n\\r\\n### How It Works\\r\\n1. **During Deployment**: Selected groups are stored with each test run\\r\\n2. **History Filtering**: Only test runs with matching user groups are displayed\\r\\n3. **Scheduler Handling**: Automated deployments are filtered out unless user has explicit group access\\r\\n4. **Access Control**: Direct test case access remains available via links\\r\\n\\r\\n### Benefits\\r\\n- **Reduced Noise**: Users don\'t see irrelevant automated deployments\\r\\n- **Focused View**: History page shows only relevant test cases\\r\\n- **Improved Performance**: Faster page loads with filtered data\\r\\n- **Better Organization**: Clear separation between manual and automated deployments\\r\\n- **Maintained Access**: Direct links still work for authorized users\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n# 2. A New Level of Security: Introducing ZeuZ Secrets\\r\\n\\r\\n## Overview\\r\\nWe are happy to announce **ZeuZ Secrets**, a powerful and totally secure system for handling all your sensitive data inside the ZeuZ platform. Now, you can forget about hardcoding API keys, passwords, and tokens in your test cases. With ZeuZ Secrets, you can store, manage, and use all your credentials securely in your test automation, and it\'s all backed by a powerful hybrid encryption model.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Your sensitive data will never even leave your browser.** To understand the full details, please read our [docs](https://docs.zeuz.ai/docs/zeuz-server/testing/Data%20Store/zeuz-secrets/).\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Feature: Centralised and Secure Secret Management\\r\\n\\r\\n![zeuz-secret](zeuz-secret.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n### What\'s New\\r\\nZeuZ Secrets gives you a special, safe vault inside the platform for all your sensitive data. It is built with a security-first mindset, making sure your secrets are encrypted the moment you create them itself, right until they are used by a trusted test node.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Key Capabilities\\r\\n- **Client-Side Encryption**: Secrets are encrypted in your browser first, *before* they are sent to the server. The server will never see the actual, unencrypted value.\\r\\n- **Hybrid Encryption**: We are using a combination of **RSA-2048** for key security and **AES-256** for data encryption. This ensures full security when data is moving and when it is stored.\\r\\n- **Node-Side Decryption**: Only a ZeuZ Node that has the correct private key can decrypt and use a secret. No one else can.\\r\\n- **Granular Access Control**: You can decide exactly which users, which test cases, and even which action patterns are allowed to access each secret.\\r\\n- **Automatic Log Masking**: Secret values are automatically hidden in all test logs, so nothing gets exposed by mistake.\\r\\n- **Centralised Management**: You can manage all secrets from one single, secure screen, with proper audit trails.\\r\\n\\r\\n### The Encryption Workflow\\r\\nThe security of ZeuZ Secrets works with a simple but very powerful end-to-end encryption process:\\r\\n1.  **Key Generation**: First, an RSA public/private key pair is generated on your ZeuZ Node.\\r\\n2.  **Configuration**: The **public key** is added to your Team in the ZeuZ admin panel. The **private key** stays safe on the Node itself.\\r\\n3.  **Secret Creation**: When you are creating a secret in the UI, it is immediately encrypted in your browser using your team\'s public key.\\r\\n4.  **Secure Storage**: The encrypted secret is then stored on the ZeuZ server. It cannot be decrypted by the server or any user without the proper private key.\\r\\n5.  **Secure Usage**: During a test run, the encrypted secret is sent to the Node. The Node uses its private key to decrypt the value at the exact moment it\'s needed for a test step.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Benefits\\r\\n- **No More Hardcoded Secrets**: This will improve your security a lot by removing sensitive data from your test cases and code.\\r\\n- **Simple Management**: Having one single place for all secrets makes managing and changing them very easy.\\r\\n- **Secure Collaboration**: You can share secrets with your teams without anyone seeing the actual secret values.\\r\\n- **Achieve Compliance**: You can track every use of a secret with detailed audit trails, linking access to specific test runs and actions.\\r\\n- **Smooth CI/CD Integration**: You can securely inject secrets into your automated CI/CD pipelines without any manual work.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Getting Started: Your First Secret in 3 Simple Steps\\r\\n\\r\\n### Step 1: Generate & Configure Keys\\r\\nOn your ZeuZ Node machine itself, you need to generate a new key pair.\\r\\n\\r\\n```bash\\r\\nuv run node_cli.py -gpk\\r\\n```\\r\\nJust copy the **public key** that is generated. Go to `Admin \u2192 Teams & Projects \u2192 Team List`, edit your team, and paste the public key in the given field. The private key is now stored safely on your node.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Step 2: Create the Secret\\r\\nGo to `Testing \u2192 Data Store \u2192 ZeuZ Secrets` and click on **Create Secret**.\\r\\n- **Secret Key**: `demo_api_key` (This is the name you will use to refer to it).\\r\\n- **Secret Value**: `sk_live_1234567890abcdef` (This is your actual secret, which will be encrypted immediately).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n### Step 3: Use the Secret in a Test Case\\r\\nIn any test step where you can give variable input, just use the special `secret` syntax to call your secret. ZeuZ will automatically handle everything, from fetching to decrypting it on the node during the test run.\\r\\n\\r\\n| id              | element parameter    | Value                           |\\r\\n| --------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------- |\\r\\n| text            | selenium action    | %\\\\|secret[\\"demo_api_key\\"]\\\\|%     |\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd that\'s it, simple only! Your test automation workflow is now fully secure.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n# 3. The Data Store, Reimagined: Faster, Simpler & More Secure\\r\\n\\r\\n## Overview\\r\\nWe\'ve rebuilt the Data Store from the ground up with a new **ReactJS** front-end. The result is a faster, more secure experience in a single, unified interface. We\'ve streamlined the entire workflow and, most importantly, locked down data security.\\r\\n\\r\\n![datastore](datastore.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n### One Page for Everything\\r\\nNo more jumping between pages to view your data and import new files. Now, you can manage tables, create folders, and import CSVs all from a single screen. The new workflow is much more intuitive and makes organizing your test data a breeze.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n### Major Security & Bug Fixes\\r\\n- **Critical Security Fix**: We fixed a major security flaw that allowed data to be visible across different teams. Your data is now **strictly isolated** to your project, as it should be.\\r\\n- **Date Filter Fixed**: The date filter was broken, and now it works reliably."},{"id":"zeuz-platform-20250909","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/zeuz-platform-20250909","source":"@site/blog/2025-09-09-zeuz-platform-20250909/index.md","title":"ZeuZ Platform 20250909","description":"Welcome to the September 2025 release of the ZeuZ platform!","date":"2025-09-09T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Changelog","permalink":"/blog/tags/changelog","description":"ZeuZ platform changelogs"}],"readingTime":8.97,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"MD Shakib Ahmed","title":"Product Engineer","url":"https://github.com/mdshakib007","page":{"permalink":"/blog/authors/shakib-ahmed"},"socials":{"github":"https://github.com/mdshakib007"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/mdshakib007.png","key":"shakib_ahmed"},{"name":"Mohammed Sazid Al Rashid","title":"Technical Lead","url":"https://github.com/sazid","page":{"permalink":"/blog/authors/sazid"},"socials":{"x":"https://x.com/sazidz","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sazidz/","github":"https://github.com/sazid","newsletter":"https://sazid.github.io"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/sazid.png","key":"sazid"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"zeuz-platform-20250909","title":"ZeuZ Platform 20250909","authors":["shakib_ahmed","sazid"],"tags":["changelog"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"ZeuZ Platform 20251015","permalink":"/blog/zeuz-platform-20251015"},"nextItem":{"title":"ZeuZ Platform 20250818","permalink":"/blog/zeuz-platform-20250818"}},"content":"Welcome to the September 2025 release of the ZeuZ platform!\\r\\n\\r\\n## \ud83d\ude80 New Features\\r\\n- **Send notifications manually:** Manually send external webhook notifications from the RunID page.\\r\\n- **Release Report Default Query Creation System:** Guided 5-step wizard to auto-generate queries for ZeuZ, Pull Requests, and GitHub Issues, streamlining workflow setup.\\r\\n- **Release Report Share:** Complete rewrite with modular structure, improved performance, and modern UI \u2014 including Security Monitoring, Enhanced Testing Analytics, and Jira Integration.\\r\\n- **Cleanup Scheduler:** Automated system to manage storage space and maintain database performance by periodically removing old test run data and log files.\\r\\n- **Notification System Redesigned:** A new UI notification system with clear stats, color-coded categories, quick navigation, and faster ways to find and act on updates.\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n## \ud83d\udc1b Bug Fixes\\r\\n- **Global Attachment page:** `memory leak`, `delete attachment` & `download attachment` bugs fixed.\\r\\n- **Web Automation:** Text paste with `(Ctrl+V)` bug fixed.\\r\\n- **Deploy page:** `Notify External Services Only on Fail` flag bug fixed.\\r\\n- **Redirect on Login:** After login, redirect to the page you were trying to access.\\r\\n- **Select Objective:** Deploy page\'s *Select Objective* infinite loading bug fixed.\\r\\n\\r\\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Improvements\\r\\n- **Slack & Discord notification:** Improved the UI for Discord & Slack notifications.

The `99+` cap avoids overwhelming the user while still signaling urgency.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Smart notification bell](smart-notification-bell.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Advanced Filtering & Search\\r\\n- Search notifications by title, message.\\r\\n- Category filters: **REQ, TASK, BUG, TC, TEST, Batch**.\\r\\n- Tabs for **All** and **Unread**, with counters.\\r\\n- Filters and tabs mirror daily workflows, so users can quickly jump to the right set of notifications. Having **All** and **Unread** in one place ensures nothing slips through while still keeping the focus on new items.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Notification slider](notification-slider.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n![Notification filter](notification-filter.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Interactive Features\\r\\n- Click to navigate directly to the related page.\\r\\n- Auto-mark as read when clicked.\\r\\n- Highlighting for unread notifications.\\r\\n- Friendly timestamps (\u201c2 hours ago\u201d, \u201cyesterday\u201d).\\r\\n- Each interaction reduces friction: clicking a notification takes you straight to context, marking as read happens automatically, and highlights make new items stand out. Relative timestamps provide instant understanding of recency, while animations and empty states make the system feel responsive and clear.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Visual Stats and Layout\\r\\n- Cleaner layout with higher readability.\\r\\n- Top-level stats (unread counts, categories) provide at-a-glance awareness.\\r\\n- Color-coded categories improve instant recognition.\\r\\n- The layout is designed to surface the most important information first. Stats at the top summarize workload immediately, while color-coded categories help users recognize item types without reading in detail. The clean hierarchy makes the panel easy to scan, even on smaller devices.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Notification slider](notification-layout.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Switch browser window/tab (Includes Playwright capability)\\r\\n\\r\\n### \ud83d\udcdd Summary\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \\"Switch browser window/tab\\" action now supports Playwright. Users can perform this action using Playwright through a remote-debugging port. Previously, this action only supported Selenium. Now, users can perform this action with both Selenium and Playwright according to their preference.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis update is a part of our broader plan to enable both Selenium and Playwright to perform ZeuZ actions. The goal is to let users choose according to their preference instead of enforcing one.\\r\\n\\r\\n### \u2728 Update Highlights\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Why have both options?\\r\\n\\r\\nPlaywright is comparatively newer and better in some areas than Selenium. What happens when the user wants to migrate from Selenium to Playwright? Do they need to rewrite the test cases that are already using Selenium? Having both Selenium and Playwright makes the migration smooth and easy. With this update, which is a part of our broader plan to enable both options to perform ZeuZ actions, users can easily shift to use Playwright while ensuring they do not necessarily need to change their legacy test cases and setup to make them compatible with Playwright.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Easy switch\\r\\n- Users can easily switch between Selenium and Playwright to perform the mentioned action. If the \\"playwright\\" row parameter is true, then the action will use Playwright to switch between tabs; otherwise, Selenium will perform the action.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Playwright integration](playwright-integration.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Remote debugging port\\r\\n- To enable Playwright capabilities, users need to provide a remote debugging port. Users only need to provide the remote debugging port for the first webpage only. After that, users can switch to any webpage (i.e., tab) on the webdriver using Playwright. Make sure the port is not blocked. Refer to the screenshot below for providing the remote debugging port. For Selenium, providing a remote debugging port is not required.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Enable Playwright integration](enable-playwright-integration.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Switch tab by title\\r\\n- Users can switch the tabs by title using Playwright. Selenium still supports switching tabs both by title and index.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Switch tab by title](switch-tab-by-title.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n<video controls loop>\\r\\n  <source src=\\"/blog/zeuz-platform-20250909/switch-tab-demo.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\r\\n</video>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## RunId page redesign\\r\\n### Summary\\r\\n\\r\\n<video controls loop>\\r\\n  <source src=\\"/blog/zeuz-platform-20250909/runid-page-redesign.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\r\\n</video>\\r\\n\\r\\nThe previous RunId page was originally built with jQuery. While it worked, it had several limitations: users had to perform multiple clicks for simple actions, the design felt outdated, and the overall experience wasn\u2019t optimized for quick decision-making.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs part of our commitment to improving usability and speed, we rebuilt the RunId page in React.js. The redesign is not only more modern and faster, but it also focuses on reducing friction, surfacing the most important information at a glance, and creating a smoother workflow for both testers and reviewers.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Update Highlights\\r\\n- Unified RunID and Execute page\\r\\n- Better and Modern Log view\\r\\n- Faster loading speed\\r\\n- Statistics about test cases\\r\\n- Cleaner design with more information at a glance\\r\\n\\r\\n### Statistics about test cases\\r\\n\\r\\n![RunID stats](runid-stats.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n**Why:** Users often need to see the overall health of a run before diving into details.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Benefit:** Statistics are now displayed at the top, giving immediate insight into test results. This helps teams prioritize where to focus first.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Testcase Status Breakdown:** See how many test cases were Passed, Failed, Blocked, Skipped, or Submitted at a glance. This gives an instant overview of overall run stability.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Priority Breakdown:** Results are grouped by Priority 1, 2, 3, and 4 test cases. Each priority level shows how many were Passed, Failed, Blocked, or Skipped.\\r\\n\u2192 This helps teams identify whether critical (P1/P2) tests are passing, so urgent issues can be addressed first.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Feature Breakdown:** Test cases are broken down by feature, showing Passed, Failed, Blocked, Skipped, and Submitted counts.\\r\\nFeatures are sorted by the total number of Failed + Blocked test cases, and only the top 10 are shown.\\r\\n\u2192 This highlights the riskiest areas in the product so teams know where to focus fixes.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Top Failing Steps:** A list of the most common failing steps across all test cases. Clicking a failing step instantly applies filters to show where and why it\u2019s failing.\\r\\n\u2192 This helps identify recurring issues and speeds up root cause analysis.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Better and Modern Log view\\r\\n**Why:** The old logs were hard to grasp and analyze, looked old, and slowed down debugging.\\r\\n**Benefit:** The new log viewer is more interactive:\\r\\n- Filter by test step\\r\\n- Filter by test status (Error, Warning, Passed)\\r\\n- See more details about test steps by clicking Show Test steps\\r\\n- We can give more space to logs by dragging between steps and logs\\r\\n\\r\\n### Cleaner design\\r\\n**Why:** The previous layout was cluttered and required extra clicks to update information.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Benefit:**\\r\\n- The RunId details card now shows all relevant information (version, objective, milestone, comments) in one place, reducing context switching.\\r\\n- Test case details cards are collapsible, keeping the interface clean while still allowing quick access.\\r\\n- Hover actions surface Logs, Bugs, and Execution buttons without overwhelming the view.\\r\\n- Inline step status changes and commenting make updates faster and smoother.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Unified RunID and Execute page\\r\\n\\r\\n![RunID execute manual](runid-execute-manual.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n**Why:** Previously, users had to navigate to a separate page to manage manual test cases, which broke workflow and added friction.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Benefit:** Now everything is unified on one page.

The process is now completely streamlined!\\r\\n\\r\\n[View the accompanying ZeuZ Node release](https://github.com/AutomationSolutionz/Zeuz_Python_Node/releases/tag/v20.0.0)\\r\\n\\r\\n<video controls loop>\\r\\n  <source src=\\"/blog/zeuz-platform-20250518/Connect ZeuZ Node.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\r\\n</video>\\r\\n\\r\\n## AI-Powered Mobile Inspector\\r\\n\\r\\nInspect Android\u2122 applications directly within ZeuZ Server without installing additional tools like Appium Inspector or Android uiautomatorviewer.\\r\\n\\r\\nSay goodbye to hours of setup frustration! Simply connect your mobile device or launch an emulator, run ZeuZ Node, and connect to ZeuZ Server. Everything else is handled automatically. This also solves a persistent challenge:\\r\\n\\r\\n> No more restarting the adb server after each inspection through Appium/uiautomatorviewer.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Features:**\\r\\n\\r\\n1. **Enhanced Screenshot and Element Tree Detection:** Improved accuracy in detecting and displaying UI elements\\r\\n2. **Dedicated Attribute List Panel:** Right-side panel for comprehensive element attribute inspection\\r\\n3. **Powerful Search Functionality:** Use **Ctrl+F** to search by CSS, XPath, or value\\r\\n4. **Dual DOM Support:** Both ADB and Appium now provide DOM access, eliminating inspection barriers when the Appium server is active\\r\\n\\r\\n![Mobile inspector](mobile-inspector.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n## Variable Viewer in Debug Page\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen debugging test cases, users often need to inspect current ZeuZ node variables to build further actions. Our new hierarchical tree view of variables provides a clean, intuitive interface for navigating complex data structures. Variables are displayed in three distinct formats:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. **JSON Object Variables:** Standard JSON-compatible variables with reasonably sized values\\r\\n2. **JSON Schema Variables:** Large JSON variables truncated for readability and presented as schemas\\r\\n3. **Non-JSON Variables:** Non-JSON objects (e.g., Python modules, WebDriver instances, WebDriver elements) with up to 200 properties displayed\\r\\n4. **Oversized Values:** Variables with excessively large values are omitted for performance optimization\\r\\n\\r\\n![Debug variable viewer](debug-variables.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n## AI-Powered Release Report Summary\\r\\n\\r\\nOur intelligent report summary component analyzes release data and presents key insights through a modern UI. This feature enables stakeholders to quickly assess release impact, quality, and notable changes without wading through lengthy detailed reports.\\r\\n\\r\\n![AI-Powered release report summary](ai-powered-release-report-summary.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n## Pre-requisite Test Case\\r\\n\\r\\nThis powerful new feature allows one test case to specify another as its pre-requisite. When a test case is deployed, its pre-requisite test case executes first.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen multiple test cases share a common pre-requisite and are deployed together, the pre-requisite executes only once throughout the entire RunID (run session), improving efficiency.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe system intelligently prevents cyclic dependencies during both link time and deployment time.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Background:**\\r\\n\\r\\n- Testers typically need pre-test setup like data preparation or environment configuration. Previously, users relied on set re-ordering to ensure pre-setup tests ran first.\\r\\n- Some test sets contain multiple test case groups with their own pre-requisites.\\r\\n- Test cases with pre-requisites may appear in multiple sets.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese factors previously made it challenging to debug or run test cases with pre-requisite steps. Our solution streamlines this process completely.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Pre-requisite search in test case details tab:**  \\r\\n![pre-requisite search in test case details tab](pre-requisite-search-in-tc-detail.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n**Pre-requisite, once selected:**  \\r\\n![Pre-requisite, once selected](pre-requisite-once-selected.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n**Rerun and pre-requisite selection from Testing > Run tests page:**  \\r\\n![Rerun and pre-requisite selection from Testing > Run tests page](rerun-and-pre-requisite-in-run-test.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n## Rerun an Existing RunID\\r\\n\\r\\nUsers can now re-run an existing RunID or selected test cases within a RunID, addressing common operational challenges:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. When a test case fails due to a temporary issue, there\'s no need to rerun an entire test set of 1,000+ cases just to achieve a green RunID status.\\r\\n2. If a node terminates prematurely before sending reports to the server (e.g., due to memory constraints), leaving test cases marked as \\"submitted\\" in the RunID, you can now easily rerun just those affected cases.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Search RunIDs for rerun (Testing > Run tests > Advanced settings):**  \\r\\n![Search runids for rerun](search-runids-for-rerun.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n## Fail Analysis Report\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen multiple test cases fail, identifying root causes and avoiding duplicate bug reports can be challenging. Our Fail Analysis Report solves this by analyzing failed test steps for common failure patterns and grouping them intelligently.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen one test case in a group is fixed, all related test cases should automatically resolve as long as the steps are global, dramatically improving efficiency.\\r\\n\\r\\n### How It Works\\r\\n\\r\\nAccess the report through **Testing > Reports > Fail Analysis** and create a filter for your analysis.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Fail analysis report: configure filter](fail-analysis-report-filter.gif)\\r\\n\\r\\n- Click on Filter to select Milestone, Version, or GitHub parameters\\r\\n- In this example, we compare Milestone 2.9 with 2.8\\r\\n- The system generates a comprehensive Fail Test Case Report\\r\\n\\r\\n![Description of card view](fail-analysis-card-view-description.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n**Card View Elements:**\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Test case title\\r\\n2. Failed test case step\\r\\n3. Failure reason\\r\\n4. Assignee set\\r\\n5. Assignee feature\\r\\n6. Assignee milestone\\r\\n7. Assignee version\\r\\n8. Comment option (anyone can comment and reply)\\r\\n9. Assignee priority\\r\\n10. Assignee label\\r\\n11. Assignee folder\\r\\n\\r\\n![Fail analysis: card list view](fail-analysis-card-list.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can also view reports categorized by failure type.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Fail analysis: group by different category](fail-analysis-group-by.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n- Track pass/fail statuses at the top of the report\\r\\n- Group reports by:\\r\\n  1. Failed test case\\r\\n  2. Set\\r\\n  3. Assignee\\r\\n- Switch between the Fail tab and the GitHub tab to find linked test cases with GitHub issue filters"}]}}')}}]);

## Close Tab (Selenium + Playwright)

Close tabs reliably by title, by index, or the current active tab. Uses Playwright over CDP when requested, with automatic Selenium fallback for robustness.

### Key Benefits
- **Dual-driver support:** Playwright via CDP or pure Selenium  
- **Accurate tab selection:** Visual left-to-right order for index; filters non-page targets  
- **Dynamic DevTools port:** Uses the live remote debugging port provided by the user.  

### Example 1
| Field       | Sub Field           | Value     |
|-------------|---------------------|-----------|
| playwright  | optional parameter  | True      |
| close tab   | selenium action      | close tab |

### Example 2
| Field       | Sub Field           | Value                  |
|-------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| tab title   | input parameter     | ['Zeuz', 'Google']     |
| playwright  | optional parameter  | True                   |
| close tab   | selenium action      | close tab              |

### Example 3
| Field       | Sub Field           | Value       |
|-------------|---------------------|-------------|
| tab index   | input parameter     | [0, 1, -1]  |
| playwright  | optional parameter  | True        |
| close tab   | selenium action      | close tab   |

If neither **tab title** nor **tab index** is provided, the current active tab is closed.

When `playwright=true`, ZeuZ connects to the Selenium-launched Chrome via the dynamically detected CDP port and executes the close operation.

## Accessibility Test

Scans currently rendered webpage in the webdriver for accessibility issues using **axe-core** via Selenium. Generates three reports: raw JSON, summarized JSON, and an HTML report with visual details.

### Key Benefits
- **Comprehensive checks:**  Powered by axe-core; validates against WCAG rules for accessibility.
- **Debug accessibility issues:** Empowers developers to efficiently detect and address accessibility issues, facilitating the creation of more accessible website. 
- **Actionable output:** Summary JSON plus a human-friendly HTML report  
- **CI-friendly:** Clear return values and structured logs for automation 
 

### Usage

| Field             | Sub Field      | Value             |
|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| accessibility test | common action  | accessibility test |

### Behavior
- Uses existing Selenium session (`selenium_driver`) from shared variables  
- Waits briefly for page assets to load, injects axe, and runs analysis  
- Saves reports under **Accessibility Test Report/** with sanitized URL and timestamp  
- Logs summary counts: violations, passes, inapplicable, incomplete  

### Reports Generated
- **Raw results (JSON):** `accessibility_result_{url}_{timestamp}.json`  
- **Summary (JSON):** `accessibility_summary_{url}_{timestamp}.json`  
- **Visual report (HTML):** `accessibility_report_{url}_{timestamp}.html`  
- **Location:** `Accessibility Test Report/`  

## Requirements
- An active Selenium driver session must be available in shared variables

##  Chrome Extension Download

### Summary
Bulk install Chrome extensions during automation runs via an extension-id list. The IDs can be picked from the Chrome Web Store. 

![Web automation - add multiple extensions via extension ID from Chrome Web Store](add-extension-with-id.png)

### Use Case & Highlights
-   Provide extension-id list in `Go To Link` action. the platform will download and attach those extensions to the Automation Test browser automatically. 
-   Speed up test setup for projects that rely on extensions (ad-blockers, proxies, custom dev extensions). 

## ‚ö° Data Store Updates

### Summary
Enhanced the Data Store functionality to support multiple file uploads simultaneously, with the ability to merge multiple files into a single table. The entire user interface has been modernized by jQuery, providing a more responsive and intuitive user experience.

![Datastore - upload multiple CSVs](datastore-upload-multiple-csvs.png)

### ‚ú® Update Highlights
- **Batch Processing**: Upload multiple files in one operation.
- **File Merging**: Combine multiple data sources into unified tables.
- **Enhanced Preview**: A comprehensive summary is displayed before the final upload.
- **Streamlined Workflow**: The upload process is simplified with fewer steps and improved user guidance.

## Some More Features
- **New Variable `zeuz_tc_logs`** ‚Äì Dedicated storage for test case errors and logging information
- **Notifications (Discord & Slack)** ‚Äì Templates simplified for readability. Important failed test cases displayed at the top. Links to testcases are included for quick triage.

![New Discord/Slack notification style](new-discord-slack-notification-style.png)

- **VM detection** ‚Äì Automatic fallback to headless mode when a VM is detected and headless wasn‚Äôt selected, reduces accidental GUI failures.

## üêõ Bug Fix Updates

- **Continue Point Value Import** ‚Äì Resolved issue with continue point values not importing correctly
- **Runtime Parameters Clipboard** ‚Äì Fixed problem with pasting runtime parameters from clipboard
- **AI Multiple-Action Validation** ‚Äì Fixed multiple-action return values from AI not being properly checked
- **Take Screenshot Action** ‚Äì Fixed failure when `Take Screenshot` was the final action in a test step. 
- **Headless Window Size** ‚Äì Fixed `maximize_window` in headless mode when the window size was unset (prevents headless runs from failing).

title: Wait for an Element to Appear
---

## Purpose
The "Wait for an Element to Appear" action ensures that a specific element becomes visible on a webpage within a set time limit. This action is particularly useful handling pages or dynamic content that may take time to load, as it ensures the test proceeds only when the desired element is visible. If the element appears within the specified duration, the action passes; otherwise, it fails.

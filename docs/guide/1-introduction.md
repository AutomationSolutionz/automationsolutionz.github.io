This guide is a step by step introduction on how to create automated test cases
using the Zeuz softwares and a glimpse of some of the possible tasks you can
perform.

Zeuz is comprised of two different softwares, complementing each other.
1. Zeuz Server - This is the web application that you will use via your web
   browser to create automated test cases.
2. Zeuz Node - This is the desktop application that you will install and run on
   your computer.

Once you have created a test case in the server, you can launch Zeuz Node on
your computer and log in with your credentials. This will make your computer
available to the server so that it can deploy and run the test cases on it. If
you do not understand everything that's mentioned here just yet, no worries. We
hope that, you will start to understand the big picture as you keep progressing.

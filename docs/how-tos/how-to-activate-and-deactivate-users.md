## How to Deactivate Users

## When do the Users get deactivated?

### When an admin deactivate the user:

Deactivating a **User**, often performed by an admin, involves the suspension or revocation of a user's access and privileges within a system or platform. This action is taken for various reasons, including employee departures, policy violations, or security concerns. The process typically includes disabling login capabilities, removing access permissions, locking or freezing accounts, and revoking special privileges or services. **User** deactivation helps maintain security and control over system access.

### When a user attempts to enter their password more than five times:

When a **User** attempts to enter their password more than five times, it typically triggers a security measure. After multiple unsuccessful login attempts, the system may lock the user account temporarily to prevent unauthorized access. This is a common security practice to safeguard against brute force attacks or unauthorized login attempts. The exact number of allowed login attempts and the duration of the lockout can vary depending on system settings and security policies. **Users** may need to contact an administrator or follow a password recovery process to regain access to their account after such a lockout.

### Effects of Deactivation:

**Deactivation** has various effects depending on the context. It usually involves the suspension or disabling of a user, device, software, account, or service. For instance,  
- When a user is deactivated, they lose access to a system or platform.  
- Devices can be deactivated if reported as lost or stolen, rendering them inoperable.  
- Some software licenses allow for deactivation on one device so that the software can be deactivated on another. Deactivation in this sense releases a license for use elsewhere.  
- Account deactivation on online platforms results in the loss of access or content removal for violating terms.  

Additionally, **Deactivation** can extend to security features and services, potentially increasing vulnerability or causing service interruptions. The specific consequences of deactivation depend on the circumstances and established policies, typically serving as a security measure to prevent unauthorized access or misuse.

### Steps

1. To **Deactivate** a user, click on the **Deactivate** button of the required user.
   > The *Deactivate* button is used to disable or turn off a user's access or account, typically when they are no longer active or authorized to use the software system.

2. To see **Deactivated users**, click on the **Inactive users** button.
   > *Inactive users* typically refer to users who have been deactivated or disabled, meaning their access to the system has been restricted or removed. This is often done to ensure security and prevent unauthorized use of the software.

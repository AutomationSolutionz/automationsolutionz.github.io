## Description

### What is export and import of test cases?  

In software testing, exporting test cases typically involves saving test cases in a format that can be shared with other team members or imported into other testing tools. This can be useful for collaborating on testing efforts or for migrating test cases between different systems.  
The process for test cases can vary depending on the software being used and the specific requirements of the testing process.

Exporting and importing test cases is a common practice in software testing. 

Exporting test cases allows you to save them in a file format that can be used for backup purposes or to share with other team members.  

Importing test cases allows you to add test cases from an external source into your testing environment.  

### Why the import and export of Test Cases are necessary? 

The import and export of test cases are necessary for several reasons like:  

* Firstly, it enables reusability, as test cases can be easily transferred between different projects or testing phases.  

* Secondly, it facilitates collaboration and sharing among team members, allowing for feedback and contributions.  

* Thirdly, it supports integration with test management tools, ensuring seamless workflows.  

Importing and exporting test cases also aid in migration, backup, and recovery of testing assets. It helps meet compliance requirements and mitigates the risk of vendor lock-in. Overall, it provides flexibility, efficiency, and ease of collaboration in the testing process.

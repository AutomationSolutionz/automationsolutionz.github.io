## Fixed

<IssueItem fixedIn="20250903" title="Testing > Run Test > Objective keeps loading infinitely">

    When the user starts typing an objective, it continues to load infinitely
    and never terminates in some cases. This causes the Run Test page to become
    unusable without the use of Presets.

</IssueItem>

<IssueItem fixedIn="20250903" title="Testing > Run Test > Advanced > Send notification on fail only sends notification regardless of whether all test cases pass or not">

    When users enable the "Send notification on fail only" option from the Run Test
    page and deploy test cases, they get notified over the messaging platforms
    (Discord, Slack, Teams, etc) even if all test cases are passing.

## Not fixed

<IssueItem eta="Sep, 2025" title="Node > Auto kill existing node processes on startup is not working">

    Launching ZeuZ Node used to kill existing node processes that were run
    from the same directory. This is currently not working as expected.

</IssueItem>

<IssueItem eta="Oct, 2025" title="Admin > Users > Manage groups is undergoing overhaul">

    This feature is being re-implemented with fine grained access control to allow
    admins and users to control which group of users can see and interact with what
    in ZeuZ. Stay tuned for an update in one of the changelogs soon.

</IssueItem>

<IssueItem eta="Oct, 2025" title="Experimental cleanup scheduler">

    A new built-in scheduler has become available in the 20250909 release of the ZeuZ
    platform. However, this is still experimental and we advise not to use this feature
    in production environments. If you have QA environments set up, please test and
    provide feedback.

<IssueItem eta="Nov, 2025" title="zAI Page assistant is still under development">

    Once the zAI Assistant is ready - we'll announce it in one of our changelogs.

</IssueItem>

<IssueItem title="Testing > Run Test > Advanced > Rerun on fail is not working">

    This feature has not been implemented properly and as such this will not
    work as expected even if chosen. However, this feature has been supplanted
    with the introduction of "Rerun test cases in an existing RunID" which is
    available from the same Advanced panel or from individual RunIDs. The new
    feature enables users to rerun selected test cases again and upload the reports
    to the same RunID without creating a new one.

</IssueItem>

<IssueItem title="Testing > Batch update > None of the batch updates are safe to use at the moment">

    We recommend not using the Batch Update feature at the moment without consulting
    with us. If you have a need for it's use - please get in touch with us.

</IssueItem>

<IssueItem title="Admin > Database Backup is unavailable">

    The database backup system through the UI has been disabled and not working at the
    moment. We recommend taking backups of ZeuZ through the `backup.sh` file provided
    to you, directly from the server VM terminal. This approach takes backup of everything
    including the database, attachments, data store backups, logs and screen captures and
    everything else.

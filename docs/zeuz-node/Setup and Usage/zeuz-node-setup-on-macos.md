6. From the folder, hover over the folder name for a few seconds until a folder icon appears. Drag this icon into your terminal, move the cursor to the beginning of the line, and type `cd`. Then enter the command `chmod +x ZeuZ_Node_macos`, followed by `./ZeuZ_Node_macos`.

7. This command should navigate you to the specified location. Once inside the folder in the terminal, mark the downloaded file as executable and run it. This will automatically download and install all necessary dependencies. The process may take some time depending on your internet speed and whether it is the first time installation. After completion, wait for the connection prompt.

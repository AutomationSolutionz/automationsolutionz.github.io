title: Custom Driver
---

In ZeuZ, to execute automation process, you can use Built_In_Driver where all
our actions are declared, as well as you can build your own driver inside our
framework and run your driver along with the Built_In_Driver. This documentation
is about how you can define your own driver and make it work with the
Buil_In_Driver. We will try a demo login which is a selenium web automation test
case. For this we will try the first 2 actions with our Built_In_Driver and the
last 2 actions with a Custom Driver meanwhile collecting the resources
Built_In_Driver created.


So, First of all, we will create a test case, add a step and we will declare 2 actions inside it-
1. Go to link “https://demo.zeuz.ai/web/level/one/scenerios/login”
2. Enter Username = “zeuzTest”

In this case, we don't need to change the step settings as we are executing
these 2 actions with Built_In_Driver and its set as default.

Then suppose we want to declare 2 more actions with our own custom driver-
1. Enter password = “zeuzPass”
2. Click “Sign in” button

Executing these 2 action will complete the demo login process So, to execute our
own custom driver we need to add another step. Because step one will be executed
by Built_In_Driver.

Here, we have created Step 2. Now lets click the “Step info” button

A pop up will appear. Then click on the “View/Edit Step” button

A new window will be created. From that window you can see the default driver is
our Built_In_Driver. Now we will create our own driver by clicking the “CREATE
DRIVER” button.

Click on the “CREATE DRIVER” at the bottom of the page.

Provide a Driver Name suppose “My_driver” and click “OK”

Make Sure the driver remains at the “Assigned Driver”.

Now go back to the Edit Step page and REFRESH. There you will see your newly
created driver. Select your driver from the drop down list. Thats it now the
Step 2 will be executed by the My_driver and not with the Built_In_Driver.

So at this point, we need some action dataset to pass through the My_driver and
write code for the My_driver. You can set any dataset you want but your code and
dataset should match.

So go back to the Test case and REFRESH. Then again enter Step-2. Then add 2
actions randomly so that we can then edit them and make our own dataset. You can
edit the texts of a cell by clicking that. You can add a row with the + sign and
delete a row with the X sign, thus making your own dataset. Now we will write
code for the driver and execute selenium scripts with the dataset we just
created. First of all we need to create a python file at this location ..\Zeuz
Node\ZeuzPythonNode\Drivers\ and name the file exactly “My_driver.py”

![](/img/custom-driver/10.jpeg)

Now, open “My_driver.py” file in an Editor and write the codes for the driver.


```python
import sys
from Framework.Utilities import CommonUtil
from Framework.Built_In_Automation.Shared_Resources import BuiltInFunctionSharedResources as sr

def sequential_actions(
    dependency,
    run_time_params,
    step_data,
    test_action_info,
    file_attachment,
    temp_q,
    screen_capture,
    device_info,
    debug_actions=None,
):
    # For now we need the step_data only and the other parameters are for some advance usages
     try:
        # This is the dataset we have written in the server. Lets check in which format it is coming
        print(step_data)

        # Importing the selenium driver from Shared_Resources which was created by Built_In_Driver
        selenium_driver = sr.Get_Shared_Variables("selenium_driver")

        # Now lets distribute the step_data between functions as separate actions and execute them
        for action_dataset in step_data:
            for left, mid, right in action_dataset:
                if mid == 'my own action':
                    Enter_text(action_dataset, selenium_driver)
                    break
            for left, mid, right in action_dataset:
                if mid == 'perform click':
                    click(action_dataset, selenium_driver)
                    break

    except Exception:
        return CommonUtil.Exception_Handler(sys.exc_info(), temp_q)


def Enter_text(dataset, selenium_driver):
    for left, mid, right in dataset:
        if mid == "my own paramter" and left == "id":
            Element = selenium_driver.find_element_by_id(right)     # Finds the textbox of password
        if left == 'enter password text':
            Element.send_keys(right)       # Enters the password


def click(dataset, selenium_driver):
    for left, mid, right in dataset:
        if mid == 'perform click' and left == "id":
            Element = selenium_driver.find_element_by_id(right)     # Find sign in button
            Element.click()     # Clicks Sign in button
```

After we have written the code, now if we run node_cli.py and run the test case
from the server  we will see the Login was successful from the automation
browser.

The **Milestone** feature functions as a project tracking tool that organizes and monitors testing activities across different phases. It allows users to link test plans, executions, and results to specific stages of the project, ensuring progress is measured accurately. This feature helps teams evaluate readiness, maintain allignment with project goals, and verify that all testing tasks are completed before moving to the next stage or release.


**Milestones** are necessary in software testing for several reasons like:  

* They help track progress
* Evaluate project status
* Aid decision making.

By providing specific checkpoints, milestones enable stackholders to assess if the testing work is on track and identify potential delays.  

They also serve as opportunities to evaluate the software's quality, address any defects, and make informed decisions about readiness for deployment.  

**Milestones** facilitate effective communication and collaboration among team members and ensure that testing efforts allign with project goals. Ultimately, milestones provide structure and clarity to the testing process, ensuring a high-quality software product.

However, **Milestones** have important roles in software testing. They track progress, help with test planning and scheduling, managing risks, act as decision points, foster communication, and ensures software quality.

**Milestones** provide markers to evaluate testing phases, set deadlines, and make informed decisions. They facilitate collaboration and transparency among stakeholders and enable the measurement of software quality at different stages. 

Overall, **Milestones** play a vital role in managing project timelimes, managing risks, and ensuring the desired quality of the tested software.

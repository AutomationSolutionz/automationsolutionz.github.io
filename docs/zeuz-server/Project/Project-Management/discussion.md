A **Discussion message** is a note or comment added to a ticket where users can communicate, share updates, ask questions, or provide feedback related to that ticket.

A **System message** is an automatic notification generated used to inform users about changes or updates to a ticket. If any changes are made to a ticket, the system displays a system message indicating which user made the change, when was updated, and what was updated. This system message supports changes to the title, assignee, milestone, version, feature, status, priority, start and end dates, rejected status, testing, and labels. However, system messages are not generated for changes to followers, links, descriptions, or attachments.

### Why it matters / Use Cases:
- **Clear Context and Communication**: Provides clear context and communication by capturing user discussions within the ticket.
- **Change Traceability**: Ensures visibility and transparency by showing what was changed, when, and by whom.
- **Comprehensive Audit Trail**: Maintains a reliable audit trail, covering both human decisions and system-tracked updates.
- **Centralized Communication and Accountability**: Improves collaboration and accountability by centralizing all conversations and changes.

## Prerequisites
- Access to ZeuZ Server with permissions for **Project → Ticket → (Requirement, Task, Bug, Document)**.
- Ticket creation must be completed, as both message types appear only after a ticket exists.
- Any user who performs an action on a ticket is automatically associated with that ticket.

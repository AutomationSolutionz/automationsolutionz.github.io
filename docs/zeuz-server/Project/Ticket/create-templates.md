The **Template** Feature is a powerful tool within our platform that enables users to create and manage customized roadmaps of training for newcomers. These roadmaps, referred to as **Templates**, consist of series of tasks, each with detailed instructions, designed to guide new team members through various onboarding activities, such as exploring ZeuZ or creating test cases. Templates help ensure a standerdized and efficient onboarding process.

### Key Features 

1. **Template Creation**: Users with appropriate permissions can create **Templates** for different roles or departments. **Templates** are created by specifying a series of tasks and providing detailed descriptions for each task.  

2. **Task Management**: Within a **Template**, users can add, edit, or delete individual tasks. Tasks may include instructions, links to resources, and deadlines to help newcomers understand and complete their responsibilities.  

3. **Assignment**: **Templates** can be assigned to specific users, ensuring that each new team member receives a tailored roadmap for their role. When a **Template** is assigned, all tasks within that **Template** are copied and assigned to the selected user.  

4. **Customization**: **Templates** are highly customizable. Users can create **Templates** for various roles or departments, and **Templates** can be modified as needed to adapt to changing requirements or processes.  

5. **Progress Tracking**: Users can monitor the progress of individuals assigned to **Templates**, helping to ensure that newcomers are following the prescribed roadmap and completing tasks in a timely manner.  

### Best Practices

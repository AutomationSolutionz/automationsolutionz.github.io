## Description

### What is a Label in test cases?

A **Label** is a tag that is assigned to a test case to help organize and categorize it.  
**Labels** are used to represent the actual sensitivity of the content that is labeled.

### Why Labels are necessary for test cases?

**Labels** are actually used in software testing and it also helps to organize and categorize test cases.  
However, by assigning labels to test cases, testers can easily identify which test cases are related to each other and which ones are not.  
This helps testers to manage their test cases more efficiently and effectively.

### What is the purpose of creating and managing Labels in software testing?

Creating and manage **Labels** in software testing serves several purposes:  

1. **Organization**: *Labels* help categorize and organize test cases based on common attributes or criteria, making it easier to find and manage them.  
2. **Searchability**: *Labels* enable quick and efficient searching for specific test cases with particular characteristics or requirements.  
3. **Filtering**: Test cases can be filtered based on *Labels*, allowing testers to focus on specific subsets of test cases that are relevant to a particular test cycle or objective.  
4. **Prioritization**: *Labels* can be used to prioritize test cases, ensuring that critical or high-priority tests are easily identifiable and executed first.  
5. **Reporting**: *Labels* contribute to comprehensive reporting by grouping test cases for specific features, requirements, or components, simplifying the reporting process and facilitating analysis.  
6. **Cross-Referencing**: *Labels* can be used to cross-reference test cases with related requirements, bugs, or tasks, helping to maintain traceability and ensure comprehensive test coverage.  

In essence, creating and managing *Labels* enhances test management, organization, and efficiency throughout the software testing process.


## Steps

 1. From the **Menu bar**, go to the **Project** then **Label** option.

 2. Go to the **Labels** page.
 3. To create a new **Label**, click on the **+ New Label** button.
    > The *+ New Label* button allow users to create and assign new labels to categorize and organize test cases based on specific attributes or criteria, enhancing test management and organization.

 4. Click and enter the **Label Name**.
    > Entering the *Label Name* is necessary to create a meaningful identifier or category for grouping and organizing related test cases, facilitating efficient test management and retrieval. 
 5. Click to choose the **Label** color.
    > Choosing *Label* color serves to visually distinguish and categorize test cases, enhancing clarity and organization in test management.

 7. Click and **Search Labels**.
    > Searching *Labels* is necessary to quickly locate and apply specific *Labels* to test cases for better organization and management.
 8. To delete any **Label**, click on the **Delete** button.

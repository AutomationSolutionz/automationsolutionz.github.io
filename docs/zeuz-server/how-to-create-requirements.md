## Description

### What is Requirement in software testing?

In software testing, **Requirements** are specific functions, features, or capabilities that the software must have. They serve as foundation for testing by guiding test coverage, design, evaluation, and traceability.  

**Requirements** validate and verify the software's behaviour and support change management. By using requirements effectively, testers ensure that the software meets expectations and satisfies stakeholders.  

**Requirements** serve as the foundation for the software development and testing proccesses, outlining the expectations and criteria for the software's behaviour, performance and quality. They are typically documented in a requirements specification or a functional requirements document.  

### What is the importance of Requirement in software testing?

**Requirements** are highly important in software testing for several reasons. 
* They provide clear objectives and goals for testing, ensuring that testers have a well-defined focus.
* **Requirements** guide test coverage, helping testers identify what functionalities and areas need to be tested.
* They serve as a benchmark for evaluating the actual behaviour of the software during testing and enable traceability between requirements and test cases.
* **Requirements** also support effective communication among stakeholders and assist in managing changes in the software.  

Ultimately, **Requirements** ensure that the software meets expectations, performs as intended, and satisfies the need of stakeholders.  

## Steps

1. From the **Menu bar**, go to the **Project** then **Requirement** option.

2. Go to the **Create/Edit Requirement** page.
3. Click to **Enter the title** of the **Requirement**.
   > Entering the title of the *Requirement* is necessary to establish a clear link between the test case and the specific requirement it is designed to validate, ensuring comprehensive test coverage and traceability.

4. Fill up the information of **Details** tab  
   > Filling up the *Details* tab of *Requirement* is necessary to provide comprehensive information and context about the *Requirement*, aiding in its understanding, implementation, and validation.  

   > * **Milestone**: *Milestone* is necessary to define the specific project phase or goal associated with the requirement, aiding in project planning and tracking progress.  
   > * **Owner**: Having an *Owner* specified is essential for assigning responsibility and accountability for overseeing and managing the fulfillment of that requirement.  
   > * **Description**: A *Description* is necessary to provide detailed information and context about what the requirement details are, aiding in understanding and implementation.  
   > * **Testing required or Not required**: Specifying whether testing is required or not in requirements is essential to clarify whether a particular *Requirement* needs to be validated through testing or not, ensuring efficient allocation of resources and efforts.  
   > * **Feature**: Including a *Feature* is necessary to categorize and associate the *Requirement* with a specific functionality or aspect of the software, aiding in organization and focused testing.  
   > * **Labels**: *Labels* are required to categorize and tag requirements with relevant keywords, facilitating easy search, sorting, and organization of requirements for efficient test management and traceability.   
   > * **Start Date**: The *Start Date* is required to establish when a particular *Requirement* becomes effective or relevant, aiding in project planning and timeline management.   
   > * **End Date**: The *End Date* is required to specify the deadline or duration during which the *Requirement* is applicable or valid, assisting in project scheduling and tracking.

5. Multiple of **Labels** can also be added.
   > Adding multiple *Labels* to a *Requirement* allows for versatile categorization, making it easier to search, filter, and manage requirements based on different criteria, enhancing organization and traceability.
6. If testing is not required, then click on the **Testing ignored** button.
   > The function of the *Testing ignored* button is to designate a test case or test scenario as not being currently subject to testing, often used when a particular test is temporarily excluded from the test plan.

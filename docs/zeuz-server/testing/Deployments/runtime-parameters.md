### What is Runtime parameters in software testing and why it is necessary to add?

In software testing, **Runtime parameters** refer to the values or settings that can be passed to a test cases during its execution or runtime. These parameters are typically used to control the behaviour of the test cases or to customize its execution based on specific requirements.  

They allow testers or users to influence the execution flow of the software and observe how it behaves under different conditions.  

**Runtime parameters** are added in software testing to make the testing process more flexible and effective. It enhance testing process by allowing testers to control and customize the software's behaviour during testing.  

Overall, **Runtime parameters** play a crucial role in enhancing the testing process and ensuring comprehensive software testing.  

### Important roles of Runtime parameters

**Runtime parameters** play important roles in software testing. They enable the configurations of test environment, variation of test data, performance testing, and achieving better test coverage.

**Runtime parameters** also help adapt the software to different environments and aid in debugging and troubleshooting. By adjusting these parameters, testers can control inputs, conditions, and settings during test execution, ensuring comprehensive testing and identification of potential issues.

Overall, **Runtime parameters** enhance the effectiveness and flexibility of software testing processes, enabling testers to validate software behaviour under various scenarios and conditions.

## Steps

1. From the menu bar, navigate to **Testing** and select the **Run Tests** option.

2. Go to the **Run Tests** page.
   > The *Run Tests* page refers to a dedicated interface or platform where test cases are executed or deployed for the purpose of evaluating software functionality and performance.

3. Click on the **New Runtime Parameter** option. 
   > The *New Runtime Parameter* option allows users to define dynamic input values for test cases, enabling flexible and data-driven test execution.

4. Enter the following details:
   - **Variable Name**
   - **Tag**
   - **Actual Value**.

11. After clicking the **Export Import Runtime Parameters** button, the following two options will be available:
- **Copy to clipboard**
- **Paste from clipboard**.

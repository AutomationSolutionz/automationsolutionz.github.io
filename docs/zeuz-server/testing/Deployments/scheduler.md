### Why it matters / Use Cases:

- Automate repetitive or time-based test executions.
- Ensure reliable, consistent test runs (hourly, weekly, monthly, or custom intervals).
- Integrate testing into CI/CD pipelines to trigger tests automatically.
- Improve QA efficiency and reduce manual coordination.
- Schedule version-based or milestone-based tests before releases.

### Example Use Cases:

- Nightly regression runs to validate system validity.
- Pre-release validation to confirm build integrity.
- Automated weekend load tests.
- Data verification scripts running daily.

## Prerequisites
- Access to ZeuZ Server with permissions for **Testing â†’ Configure â†’ Scheduler**.
- An existing **Plan** or **Preset** must be created to associate with the scheduler.
- Defined **Milestones** and **Versions** within the workflow.
- A proper environment setup is required for tests to execute successfully.

## Quick-Start
1. Navigate to the **Schedule List** page.
2. Clicking on the **Create Scheduler** button, a modal like pop-up will appear. Within this modal, a user can create a scheduler without leaving the current page.

## Features
### Create a Scheduler
1. In the first step (**Step 1**), users are required to fill in the following fields:  
   - **Scheduler Name**
   - **Type**
     - **Preset**
     - **Plan**.  
   For example, we enter the "Schedule Name" as **test 1.1**, select **Plan** as the "Type" and choose a **Plan**. Once these fields are completed, we click the **Next** button.

   ![](/img/how-tos/how-to-create-schedule/schedule-step1.png)

   However, if a user tries to proceed without filling out the **Scheduler Name** or other required fields, the system will block the transition to the next step. All mendatory fields must be filled in before continuing.

   ![](/img/how-tos/how-to-create-schedule/schedule-error.png)

2. In the second step (**Step 2**), users must select a **Milestone** and a **Version**. Suppose, we select both a **Milestone** and a **Version**, and then click on the **Next** button to move on.

   ![](/img/how-tos/how-to-create-schedule/schedule-step2.png)

   Again, if these are not selected, the user will not be able to proceed to the next step.  

   ![](/img/how-tos/how-to-create-schedule/schedule-milestone.png)

3. In the third step (**Step 3**), users must configure the **Schedule Timing**. There are five types of scheduling options available:
   - **Weekly**:
     - Users select the days of the week (e.g., Tuesday, Wednesday, Saturday) and a specific time (e.g., the current time using "Now").
     - After selecting the **Days** and **Time**, clicking the **Next** button saves the configuration.

     ![](/img/how-tos/how-to-create-schedule/schedule-week.png)

   - **Every X Hours**:
     - Users set how many hours later the scheduler will run again (e.g., every 10 hours).

     ![](/img/how-tos/how-to-create-schedule/hour-schedule.png)

   - **Every X Minutes**:
     - Users set how often the scheduler will run in minutes (e.g., every 100 minutes).

     ![](/img/how-tos/how-to-create-schedule/minute-schedule.png)

   - **Calendar Schedule**:
     - Users pick a specific **Date** and **Time** from a calender.
     - After making the selection, users need to click **Add Entry** to set the schedule.

     ![](/img/how-tos/how-to-create-schedule/calendar-schedule.png)

     - However, multiple entries can be added, for example, one on the 24th July and another on a different date.

     ![](/img/how-tos/how-to-create-schedule/img-1.9.png)

   - **Month Schedule**:
     - This allows scheduling the task on specific days of the month (e.g., 6th, 10th, or 15th).
     - The day must be between **1 and 30**, and a time must be provided.
     - For example, we select the **15th** at **12:05** and add an additional entry for the **5th** at the same time.

     ![](/img/how-tos/how-to-create-schedule/img-1.11.png)

     - Multiple entries can be added as needed.

     ![](/img/how-tos/how-to-create-schedule/img-1.12.png)

4. After completing this step, move to the final step (**Step 4**). Here, **Confirmation summary** of all the scheduler details is shown including:
   - **Scheduler Name**
   - **Type (Preset/Plan)**
   - **Selected Milestone and Version**
   - **Scheduled Timing and Entries**.  
   
  Once everything is confirmed, clicking **Save Scheduler** will save the scheduler.
  The page will automatically reload, and the newly created scheduler will appear in the list.
  For example, if the scheduler was set to run on the **15th** at **12:00** and the **5th** at **12:06**, both entries will be visible as per the configuration.

### Edit Scheduler
When editing a scheduler in ZeuZ, a scrollable panel appears on the right side of the edit page. This panel contains various fields such as, 
- **Preset Name** 
- **Assigned Testers** 
- **Send Reports**  
- **Milestone** 
- **Run Objective** 
- **Node Name** 
- **Version** 
- **Dependency**
- **External Services**
- **Runtime Parameters**. 

![](/img/how-tos/how-to-create-schedule/preset-schedule.png)

![](/img/how-tos/how-to-create-schedule/objective-schedule.png)

![](/img/how-tos/how-to-create-schedule/version-schedule.png)

Within the edit view, there is also a **Status** toggle button. This button allows users to turn the scheduler **On** or **Off**. For example, if the scheduler is currently **On**, clicking the status button will change it to **Off**. Once the **Update** button is clicked, the new status is saved.

![](/img/how-tos/how-to-create-schedule/status-schedule.png)

A new status column is also displayed in the scheduler list, aligned with the **Scheduler Name**. Since the status was recently **Off**, it is now shown as **Off** in this column.

![](/img/how-tos/how-to-create-schedule/offline-schedule.png)

Other editable fields include:
- **Name**
- **Type**
- **Select (Preset/Plan)**
- **Select Milestone**
- **Select Version**
- **Schedule Type (Weekly, Every X hours, Every X minutes, Calendar schedule, Month schedule)**.  
Users can freely modify these fields. For example, if the current schedule type is set to **Month Schedule**, the user can change it to **Hour** or **Minute** based on their preference. Additionally, a different **Preset** or **Plan** and **Milestone** or **Version** can be selected. After making all necessary changes, clicking the **Update** button will save and apply the modifications.

![](/img/how-tos/how-to-create-schedule/update-schedule.png)

However, to delete a scheduler, a **Delete** button is available. When clicked, a confirmation prompt will appear asking the user to confirm deletion. If the user clicks **OK**, the specific scheduler will be permanently deleted.

![](/img/how-tos/how-to-create-schedule/delete-schedule.png)

### Search Functionality by Scheduler, Preset and Plan Name
With the new update, users can now search schedulers by **Scheduler Name**, **Preset Name** or **Plan Name** directly from the search box. For example:
- Search for schedulers by entering keywords (e.g., "test") in the search box.

![](/img/how-tos/how-to-create-schedule/search-schedule.png)

- All the matching schedulers related to the entered keyword will be displayed in the table.

![](/img/how-tos/how-to-create-schedule/matching-schedule.png)

- To return to the complete list, users can click the **Reset** button, which clears the filter and restores the original view.

![](/img/how-tos/how-to-create-schedule/reset-schedule.png)

- This functionality is consistent for searching by **Preset Name** and **Plan Name** as well.

![](/img/how-tos/how-to-create-schedule/plan-search.png)

### Bulk Status Control with "Select Scheduler" Feature
In case of updated scheduler, a feature called **Select** has now been introduced to allow bulk activation or deactivation of multiple schedulers at once.
#### How it Works:
- Users can click the **Select** button and choose multiple from the table.

![](/img/how-tos/how-to-create-schedule/select-schedule.png)

![](/img/how-tos/how-to-create-schedule/multiple-schedule.png)

After selections, two options become available:
- **Activate**: Activates all selected schedulers.
- **Deactivate**: Deactivates all selected schedulers.

#### Important Behavior:
- If an active scheduler is selected snd **Activate** button is clicked, its status remain unchanged.
- If inactive schedulers are selected and **Activate** button is clicked, their statuses will be updated to active.
- Similarly, selecting schedulers and clicking the **Deactivate** button will deactivate all selected schedulers.

![](/img/how-tos/how-to-create-schedule/activate-schedule.png)

### Schedule Time UI Enhancement
The design of the **Schedule Time** section has been updated for better usability and clarity. Users will now find it easier to configure and interpret schedule timings.
1. **For Weekly**:

![](/img/how-tos/how-to-create-schedule/weekly-status.png)

2. **For Every X Hours**:

![](/img/how-tos/how-to-create-schedule/hourly-schedule.png)

3. **For Every X Minutes**:

![](/img/how-tos/how-to-create-schedule/minute-schedule.png)

4. **For Calendar Schedule**:

![](/img/how-tos/how-to-create-schedule/calendar-schedule.png)

5. **For Month Schedule**:

![](/img/how-tos/how-to-create-schedule/month-schedule.png)

### Run History Page Updates
- A new unified column has been introduced by merging **LRT (Last Run Time)** and **Run History** into a single, consolidated view.
  - This column displays the most recent run for each scheduler.

  ![](/img/how-tos/how-to-create-schedule/run-schedule.png)

  - If a scheduler has never been executed, it shows **No run found**.

  ![](/img/how-tos/how-to-create-schedule/no-run.png)

### Detailed Run History via modal pop-up
Users can now view a condensed overview of the scheduler's run history via modal pop-up. This modal provides:
- For **Presets**: The last five executions.

![](/img/how-tos/how-to-create-schedule/last-five.png)

- For **Plan**: The last two executions of each preset under that plan.

![](/img/how-tos/how-to-create-schedule/plan-run.png)

**Example**: If a scheduler is associated with a **Plan** containing three **Presets**, the modal will display the last two run histories for each of those three **Presets**.

### View Full Run History
If users wish to view the **Complete History**, a **View Full History** button is available within the modal. Clicking this button redirects the user to the full history page for that specific plan.

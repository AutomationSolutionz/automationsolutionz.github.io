## Description

### What is a Test Schedular in software testing?  

A **Test Schedular** is a tool used in software testing to schedule and run tests at predetermined times and frequency. It helps manage large and complex tests by automating the process of scheduling and checking complex processes from one streamlined, intuitive interface.

### Why is it necessary to setup Test Schedular in software testing?

Setting up a **Test Schedular** in software testing is necessary for automation, efficiency, comprehensive test coverage, regression testing, reporting and analysis, CI/CD integration, and global testing. It automates test execution, saving time and improving productivity.  

Scheduled tests ensure that all relevant test cases are consistently executed, increasing the chances of detecting defects and regressions.  

**Test Schedular** reports provide insights into software stability and performance. Integration with CI/CD pipelines ensure thorough testing before release. Additionally, scheduling tests based on time zone enables global coverage.  

Overall, a **Test Schedular** enhances the testing process by optimizing resources, providing valuable data, and ensuring high-quality software.


## Steps

1. From the **Menu bar**, go to the **Testing** then **Run Tests** option.

3. Fill up the following informations that are available on **Run Tests/Deploy** page and **Deployment** tab.

   > Following informations are:
     * **Select Preset**
     * **Search test cases**
     * **Assign testers**
     * **Send report to**
     * **Milestone**
     * **Run Objective**
     * **Version**
     * **Platform**.

5. Click on the **More** option.
   > The *More* option typically refers to additional or extended functionalities, options, or settings that are not immediately visible but can be accessed to access advanced features or information.

   > Following More options are:
     * **Run Parameter**
     * **External Services**
     * **Objectives**.

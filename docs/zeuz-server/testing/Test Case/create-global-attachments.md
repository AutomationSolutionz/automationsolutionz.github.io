## Explanation of Global Attachment Feature
The **Global Attachment** feature in **ZeuZ** allows users to upload and manage files that can be accessed and reused across multiple test cases and test steps within a project. This eliminates the need to repeatedly upload the same files for each individual test, promoting efficiency and consistency.

### Importance of the Global Attachment Feature
1. **Reusability**  
   Files such as test data, configuration files, or reference documents can be reused in multiple test cases without duplication.
2. **Centralized Management**  
   All important files are stored in a central location, making it easier to update and maintain them.
3. **Consistency Across Tests**  
   Using the same attachment across several tests ensures uniformity and reduces errors caused by outdated or mismatched files.
4. **Improved Collaboration**  
   Testers and teams can share and access the same set of global files, enhancing team coordination and reducing miscommunication.
5. **Time-Saving**  
   Eliminates repetitive uploads, especially in large-scale testing projects with shared resources.

### Example Use Case
If a CSV file containing login credentials is required in 20 different test cases, the file can be uploaded once as a global attachment. Each test can then reference the same file, ensuring that updates are automatically reflected everywhere it's used.

In summary, the **Global Attachment** feature in **ZeuZ** is a valuable tool for maintaining efficient, consistent, and scalable test management practices.

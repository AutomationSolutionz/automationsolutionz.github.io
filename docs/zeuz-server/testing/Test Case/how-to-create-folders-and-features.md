### What is a folder?

Similar to folders in your operating system (windows, mac, linux), **Zeuz Folder** is an organizational field provided in ZeuZ so that you can organize their test cases. Users can also create nested folders. You would usually organize your test cases in a folder structure:


Regression
* Desktop
* API
* Mobile
* Web


### What is a feature?

**Features** are similar to folders but they're provided as a separate entity so that you can organize your test cases according to different features/modules of the application under test. Examples include: Login module, Dashboard module, etc. Sub-features can also be created in a nested fashion.

### Why "Folder" and "Feature" are necessary for test cases in software testing?

**Folders** and **Features** are necessary for test cases in software testing to provide organization, context, and better management.

**Folders** help categorize and structure test cases, making it easier to navigate, locate, and trace them based on specific criteria such as modules or test types.

**Features** associate test cases with relevant functionalities, ensuring a clear understanding of what is being tested. They contribute to comprehensive test coverage, prioritization of critical areas, and efficient maintenance of test cases as the software evolves.

Overall, **Folders** and **Features** enhance the organization, effectiveness, and maintainability of test cases in the testing process.

## Steps

1. From the **Menu bar**, go to the **Testing** then **Search** option.

2. Click on the **Toggle Tree** button.
   > The *Toggle Tree* button allow users to expand or collapse the hierarchial test case folders and features for better organization and navigation.

3. To create a **Folder**, click on the **Create top level Folder** button.
   > Creating *Folder* for test cases is necessary for better organization, categorization, and efficient management of test cases, improving overall test suite maintenance.

   > The *Create top level Folder* button is used to create a new folder or feature at the top level of the test case hierarchy for better categorization and management.

4. Click and enter the **Name of the new folder**.
5. Click on the **OK** button.
   > Entering the *Name of the new folder* is necessary for clear identification and effective organization of test cases under the appropriate folder.

6. Similarly, to create a **Feature**, click on the **Create top level Feature** button.
   > Creating *Feature* is necessary for grouping related test scenarios, providing better traceability, and enabling more focused testing efforts on specific functionalities or components.

   > The *Create top level Feature* button allow users to create a new feature or functionality at the highest level of the test case hierarchy, enabling better organization and focused testing efforts.

7. Click and enter the **Name of the Feature**.
8. Click on the **OK** button.
   > Entering the *Name of the Feature* is necessary for clear identification, proper categorization, and effective traceability of test scenarios related to that feature.

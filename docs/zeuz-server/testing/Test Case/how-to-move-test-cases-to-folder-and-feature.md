### Why is it necessary to move Test Cases to Folder?  

Moving test cases to folders are necessary for several reasons like:

* Firstly, it helps with organization and structure. By grouping test cases into folders, it provides a logical arrangement that makes it easier to locate and manage them.

* Secondly, it aids in test case management. Test cases can be categorized, sorted, and filtered based on specific criteria, making them easier to track and maintain.

* Thirdly, it facilitates test suite creation. Test cases within folders can be grouped together to create test suites, which are collections of related test cases. This simplifies test planning and execution.

Additionally, moving test cases to folders supports test case reusability, collaboration and sharing among team members, version control and overall efficiency in managing the testing process.  

### Why is it necessary to move Test Cases to Feature?  

Moving test cases into test case features are necessary for several reasons like:

* Firstly, it improves test case organization by grouping them based on specific features or functionalities. This enhances efficiency in managing and locating test cases.

* Secondly, it enhances test case traceability by aligning them with corresponding requirements or user stories. It ensures comprehensive testing and identifies any gaps in coverage.

* Thirdly, it enables a targeted testing approach, allowing testers to focus on specific features during testing. This improves test coverage and issue identification. 

Additionally, it simplifies test case maintenance, facillitates collaboration, and enhances test planning and execution. Overall, organizing test cases into features improve efficiency, traceability and effectiveness in testing.

3. Click on the **More** option.
   > The function of the *More* option is to provide access to additional actions, settings, or features related to managing and manipulating the test case.

   > The following *More* options are: 
   * **Download CSV of description and expection** : The meaning of *Download CSV of description and expectation* is to export the test case details, including action descriptions, and expected outcomes, in CSV format for external analysis or documentation.
   * **Move to folder** : The meaning of *Move to Folder* is to relocate or reorganize specific test cases into a designated folder for better management and organization. 
   * **Move to feature**  : The meaning of *Move to Feature* is to reassign or categorize specific test cases under a different functional or feature-related group for improved organization.
   * **Batch Update**  : The meaning of *Batch Update* is to simultaneously modify or apply changes to a group of selected test cases in a coordinated manner.
   * **Steps**  : *Steps* refer to the detailed actions or instructions that define how a specific test scenario should be executed and validated.
   * **Actions**  : *Actions* represent the individual tasks or operations performed to simulate user interactions and validate the functionality of the server.
   * **Delete Test Cases**  : *Delete Test Cases* refer to remove specific test cases parmanently from the test case repository or management system.
   * **Sample Test Cases**  : *Sample Test Cases* refer to a subset of predefined test cases used to demonstrate the testing process and provide examples of how to validate specific functionalities.
   * **Export Selected Test Cases**  : *Export Selected Test Cases* means creating a downloadable file containing the details of the chosen test cases for sharing or backup purposes.
   * **Import Test Cases**  : *Import Test Cases* involves incorporating external test case data into a test management system for execution and tracking.
   * **Create Test Cases from JIRA** : *Create Test Cases from JIRA* refers to generating new test cases based on requirements or issues managed within the JIRA project management tool.

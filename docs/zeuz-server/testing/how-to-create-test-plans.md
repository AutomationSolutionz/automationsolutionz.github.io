## How to create a Test Plan

### Steps
1. To create a **Test Plan**, click the **+ Create new plan** button.  
   > The *+ Create new plan* button initiates the creation of a new test plan, facilitating efficient organization and documentation of testing activities in software testing.

2. Enter the **Plan Title** as well as **Description** of the plan.
   > Entering the **Plan Title** and **Description** are necessary to provide a clear and descriptive outline of the testing project.  
   The *Plan Title* serves as an identifier, helping testers and stakeholders quickly understand the purpose or focus of the testing effort.  
   The *Description* offers detailed insights into the scope, objectives, and key features of the test plan, ensuring that all team members have a common understanding of the testing strategy.

3. Click the **Create Plan** button.

4. Click on the created **Test Plan** and add the required **Presets**.  
   > Adding required *Presets* are necessary to establish standardized configurations, settings, and criteria, ensuring consistency, efficiency, and reliability across the testing process. Presets facilitates an uniform testing environment, reducing the likelihood of errors and streamlining the testing workflow by eliminating the need for manual configuration before each test. This practice not only enhances the repeatability of test scenarios but also promotes a cohesive testing approach. In summary, incorporating presets into the test plans is essential for maintaining a standardized, efficient, and error-resistant testing process in software development.

5. Click the **Add** tab on the **Test Plan** page.

6. Select the required **Presets**.  
   > Selecting required *Presets* in test plans ensures a standardized, efficient, and error-resistant testing process by establishing consistent configurations and settings.

7. To add the required **Presets**, click the **ADD SELECTED** button.

title: Wait for an Element to Disappear
---

## Purpose
The "Wait for an Element to Disappear" action ensures that a specific element is no longer visible on a webpage within a given time frame. This is particularly useful for handling loading indicators or temporary messages, as it ensures that tests proceed only after the element has disappeared. If the element disappears within the specified duration, the action passes; otherwise, it fails.

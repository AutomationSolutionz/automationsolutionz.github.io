This course guides you on how use to ZeuZ Node from the very basics
and also teaches you some of the best practises on different topics.
After completing this course, you should be confident enough to jump
right in and start automating complex scenarios or explore the vast
amount of actions available at your disposal from ZeuZ Server.

The course is divided into levels starting from Level 1. We advise you
to start from Level 1 even if you have experience in automation. This
will let you gain confidence on how to use the different actions
instead of confusingly trying them out on your own.

title: 2. First Test case
---

A test case is a scenario in your application that you want to test. Some
example scenarios might be:

- Log in and verify that we can log in.
- Sign up and verify that the user was created using REST APIs.
- Fill up contact form and verify that we received the email using APIs.

We'll be creating our first test case in Zeuz Server using the "Test Case
Wizard".

1. Launch your browser and log in to the Zeuz Server that we have set up for
   you.
2. In the dashboard/home page, you will see a red button labelled "Test Case
   Wizard". Click on it to start the wizard and it will guide you through
   creating a simple test case. This will also explain each of the items
   required for creating a test case.

Once you've gone through the wizard, take the time to go through the test case
create/edit page by yourself one more time and try to make sense of what each of
the items do.

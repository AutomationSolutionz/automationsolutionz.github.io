Actions are the core of Zeuz. There are various types of actions that you can
perform using Zeuz. The actions are not restricted to just one platform at a
time. You can execute actions for multiple platforms from the same test case,
which means your test case can do some very complicated tasks.

For instance, you can write a single test case where:

1. Sign up via web automation.
2. Verify that the sign up is successful by making a REST API call and testing
   its response.
3. Log in with the stored credentials (yes, you can save variables and recall them!).
4. Send a message to a user.
5. Make a query to your database to see if the message was stored properly.

As you can see, your test case can vary wildly depending on the scenario that
you're trying to test.

## Description

### What is a bug in software testing? 

A bug in software testing is a flaw or default in a component or system or software that can cause the components or system to fail to perform its required functions. In other words, if the bug or defect is encountered during the execution of the test, it may cause the failure of the components, that is, does not work as it is expected from the component.  

### Why bug reports are necessary in software testing? 

Bug reports are necessary in software testing because they help identify bugs that can cause the software or system to fail to perform its required functions.  
When you find a bug, it is essential to report the bug for it to be fixed properly. Writing a bug report is thus a crucial stage of the bug lifecycle, which comes right after it is identified.  
A good bug report covers all the crucial information about the bug, which can be used in the debugging process. It helps with a detailed bug analysis and gives better visibility about the bug and helps find the right decision and approach towards debugging. It also saves cost and time by helping debug at an earlier stage.

### Bug Details Tab

   * **Feature**: Click on **Choose Feature** button and select the feature and at the right side of it there is a **Plus sign (+)** which helps to create a feature.

   * **Priority**: During the edit of test cases, we need to select the **Priority**, similarly for the creation/edit of bugs of test cases, we also need to select the **Priority** of it among **P1**, **P2**, **P3** and **P4**.

   * **Labels**: For selection of **Label**, click on **Label** field and select **Label**. However, for a new **Label**, click on **Plus sign (+)** which indicates **Create new label** and for default **Label**, click on **Tick sign** which indicates **Make individual default label**.

   * **Start Date**: We need to select the **Start Date** of the bug that will be linked to the test case.

   * **End Date**: Just like the **Start Date** we need to give the **End Date** of the bug during the edit.

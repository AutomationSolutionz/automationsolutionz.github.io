## Description

### What is a Task in software testing?

In software testing, a **Task** refers to a specific action performed by testers to ensure the quality of a software application. These **Tasks** include planning the testing approach, designing test cases, executing tests, reporting defects, documenting testing artifacts, setting up test environments, preparing test data, analyzing test results, and closing the testing phase.  

Through these **Tasks**, testers identify issues, validate the software against requirements, and provide feedback on its performance. Testing tasks are carried out iteratively to ensure the software meets expectations and delivers a positive user experience. 

### Why Task is necessary for software testing?

**Tasks** are necessary for software testing as they provide a structured approach to ensure quality. They help testers systematically validate the software against requirements, identify defects, and report issues. They help testers achieve comprehensive test coverage, allocate resources efficiently, and ensure consistency and reproducibility.  

**Tasks** also aid in identifying and reporting defects, tracking progress, and documenting the testing process. Moreover, they aid in mitigating risks by proactively identifying vulnerabilities and addressing them before software release. Overall, tasks streamline the testing process, enhance efficiency, and improve the quality of the software being tested.  

## Steps

1. From the **Menu bar**, go to the **Project** then **Task** option.

2. Go to the **Create/Edit Task** page.
3. Click to **Enter the title** of the task.
   > Entering the *Title* of the task is necessary to provide a clear and descriptive label for the specific task being performed, aiding in task management and traceability.

4. Fill up the information of **Details** tab.
   > Filling up the information of *Details* tab is necessary to provide comprehensive context and instructions for executing the *Task* accurately.

    > * **Milestone**: *Milestones* are necessary to define critical points or goals within the task's execution timeline, helping in planning, tracking, and achieving project objectives.  
    > * **Assigned User**: Assigning a user in a *Task* is necessary to specify who is responsible for carrying out the *Task*, ensuring accountability and clear *Task* ownership.  
    > * **Feature**: *Feature* is necessary to associate the *Task* with a specific functionality or aspect of the software, aiding in organization and focused testing efforts.  
    > * **Priority**: Assigning a *Priority* to a *Task* is necessary to determine the order or importance of the *Task* in relation to the other *Tasks*, helping in task management and scheduling.  
    > * **Description**: *Description* is required to provide detailed information and context about the *Task*, aiding in understanding and accurate *Task* execution.  
    > * **Version**: *Version* is necessary to specify the software version or build to which the *Task* is related, ensuring proper allignment with the software under test.  
    >* **Start Date**: The *Start Date* in a *Task* is necessary to indicate when the *Task* should commence or become relevant, aiding in project planning and scheduling.  
    >* **End Date**: The *End Date* in a *Task* is necessary to specify the deadline or duration during which the *Task* should be completed, assisting in project scheduling and time management.  
    >* **Labels**: *Labels* in a *Task* are necessary for categorization and tagging, allowing *Tasks* to be organized and grouped based on relevant keywords or criteria for efficient task management and traceability.  
    >* **Make Private**: The *Make Private* feature in a *Task* is necessary to restrict access to the task's details and ensure that only authorized individuals can view or modify sensitive information, enhancing security and confidentiality.  
    >* **Not rejected**: The *Not rejected* feature in a *Task* is required to indicate that the *Task* has not been rejected or invalidated, providing clarity on the task's status and progress.  
    >* **Testing required**: The *Testing required* feature in a *Task* is necessary to specify that the *Task* must undergo testing to ensure its functionality and compliance with requirements, helping to prioritize and plan testing efforts.

5. Multiple of **Labels** can also be added.
   > Adding multiple of *Labels* to a *Task* are necessary for versatile categorization, allowing *Tasks* to be associated with various keywords or criteria, facilitating flexible organization and search functionality.
6. Click on the **Save** button.

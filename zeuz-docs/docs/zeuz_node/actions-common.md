### 8. **Delete Mail**
This action allows the deletion of an email by specifying the host, username, password, and sorting criteria such as seen/unseen status, flagged/non-flagged status, or a date range, with the required date format being YYYY-M-D.

### 9. **Execute Python Code**
The **Execute Python Code** action enables users to run custom Python scripts within the framework by specifying a file path, uploading a file, or writing the code directly. It allows interaction with variables from previous steps, and the output is automatically saved to shared variables for use in subsequent actions. This feature provides flexibility for executing custom logic and handling data during workflow processes.

### 10. **Extract number OR Convert data type**
This action is used to extract numbers from a string (or list) and/or convert data between types like string, integer, and float, with options to store the output in a specified variable, round float numbers to a specific decimal point, use an index to extract multiple numbers from a string, and apply functions like ceiling, floor, or rounding when converting floats to integers.

### 11. **Generate Date & Time**
This action allows users to display the current date and time in various customizable formats, with the ability to add or substract days, weeks, months, or years from the current date.

### 12. **Log Info**
This action allows users to display a message in the console during test execution and simultaneously write the same message to the log file for record-keeping.

### 13. **Read and save mail**
This action allows users to read or delete emails by providing specific parameters such as host, username, password, and sorting criteria. The user can filter emails based on various attributes such as subject, text, sender, receiver, flagged or checked status, or date ranges. Sorting options include seen or unseen emails, flagged status, or messages from a particular date or range. The results can be saved to a variable for further use. Additionally, the action supports waiting for a specific time before retrieving the next email or specifying the directory to save email attachments.

### 14. **Read from Excel**

### 15. **Run Actions**
This action allows users to run previously defined actions within a step without duplicating them. It can execute actions in loops, either repeating until a condition is met or for a specific number of iterations. The loop structure can be customized by specifying conditions like pass/fail, iteration count, or counter limits. Additional settings enable users to exit loops when conditions are met, such as after a specified number of failures.

### 16. **Step Exit**
This action will exit the step with a result pass or fail.  
This action can be used in a condition where, if something is matched or does not match, it can be decided to either fail the test case or continue with a pass.  
This can be added to various other actions such as conditional actions, to determine if a test case should pass or fail. The result can be either pass or fail.

### 17. **Extract Date**
This action extracts a date from a string, even when the string contains other text, converting it into a date type, and allows for an optional parameter to specify the desired output format, as demonstrated in the example where the date "25 February 2020" is extracted and saved in the variable **my_var** as "2020-02-25".

### 18. **File - Delete**
The **delete** action is a fundamental command in the file management systems used to remove files or folders from a specified disk location. To execute this action, the user specifies the source of deletion (file_to_be_deleted) and the path (e.g., /Music/acb) from which the item will be deleted. The action is categorized as a utility action, targeting either a file or a folder. For instance, using the command to delete **/Music/test.txt** instructs the system to remove the **test.txt** file from the **Music** directory, effectively making it unavailable for future access. Understanding this command is essential for effective data management.

### 19. **Folder - Delete**
The **delete** action is a command used in file management systems to remove a specified folder from a disk location. Users must identify the source folder and provide its path (e.g., /Music/acb) to execute the deletion. As a utility action, it specifically targets a folder, distinguishing it from file deletions. For example, executing the command to delete **/Music/acb** instructs the system to remove the **acb** folder within the **Music** directory, making it inaccessible for future use. Mastering this command is essential for effective data organization and management.

### 20. **Random email delete**
This action will delete randomly generated email (which is created by Random email generator Action).

### 21. **Random email generator**
This action will create a random email address and saved the email address into the given variable name.

### 22. **Random email read**
This action is actually based on random email (generated by our Random generated email Action). It will collect all the emails and save them to the variable name.

### 23. **Generate uuid**
The action generates a unique ID using Python's UUID module and then replaces a specified substring within a file with the generated ID. The replacement can be case-sensitive and can replace all instances or just the first one. However, to generate unique ID with **Python uuid** module, we can use any **uuid** function inside `%||%` sign.

### 24. **Check mail by user**
This action checks for the existence of an email using the provided credentials and parameters, passing if the email is found and failing if not. If you choose not to verify the sender's name, you can delete the corresponding row, as it is optional.

### 25. **Send mail by user**
The purpose of this action is to send an email to a particular recipient. Here we are sending email using smtp protocol, so we need a smtp server and a port to connect to, then login into that server using the sender's email and password. After that we need the email of a recipient, the subject and the body to be sent to that recipient. One thing to note here is that for gmail tls report 587 is mandatory here and you should should make your gmail account less secured for app access before testing.

### 26. **Voice Command Response**
This action allows communication with a voice-activated device, like Alexa. The computer first speaks the wakeup word (e.g., "Alexa") followed by a command (e.g., "What's today's date"). It then listens for a response from the Alexa device, converts the spoken response into text, and stores it in a variable. You can adjust optional settings like voice name, speed, language, and microphone number. The default values are voice speed at 140, voice name as 'default', and microphone number set to 1.

### 27. **Authenticator Code Generator**
This action automates the generation of a two-factor authentication (2FA) code using an authenticator app in the background. The secret key, often stored as a QR code, needs to be provided and can be securely saved in an Environment Variable. By using `%|os.environ["AUTH"]|%`, the action retrieves the secret key and generates the current 2FA code for secure login. A name can be assigned for convenience alongside the secret code.

### 28. **Classifier AI**
This action uses the "Facebook-bart" AI model to classify a given text into a specified category, providing a confidence score, while also allowing file uploads to hidden elements on a webpage by specifying the element's ID and file path.

### 29. **Compare Partial Variables or Text**
The action allows users to compare two variables or a stored variable against a static value with a focus on partial matching. This feature enables flexibility by evaluating whether one string contains part of another, making it useful for validating conditions in dynamic data scenarios. Users must first save a variable using the "Save Variable" action to use this feature.

### 30. **Compare Two Lists and Save The Difference**
Sometimes we need to compare two list variables and need to use the elements which are in the 1st list but not in 2nd.  
**How it works**: Here compare means set difference. The action will return a single value from the compare list (1st value). For example, A = [1, 2, 3], B = [4, 5, 6]. List difference = A - B = [1, 3] (compare list), the return value is 1 (1st value).

### 31. **Create and Edit Screenshot**
The action refers to a screenshot function that allows users to capture their screen while excluding specific areas, resulting in those sections appearing as blacked-out regions in the final image.

### 32. **Custom Step Duration**
The action is used to adjust the step duration for performance measurement purpose.  
**Valid time formats**
1. HH:MM:SS.ffffff
2. MM:SS.ffffff
3. SS.ffffff
4. SS.  
**H-Hours**, **M-Minutes**, **S-Seconds**, **f-Milliseconds**.

### 33. **Data store get data**
Retrieving datastore table rows as a list of dictionaries, which can also be used to obtain specific column values.

### 34. **Data store overwrite**
This action will overwrite existing data, so exercise caution; it requires a list of lists of strings. It was created because the datastore write action did not fulfill all requirements. Therefore, format the data as needed using Python code before overwriting the table.

### 35. **Data store read**
The action is designed to **read data from a datastore** and store the result in a variable. The purpose of this action is to retrieve data from a specified datastore table and save the output into a variable for further use.

### 36. **Data store write**
The action is for **updating data in a datastore** and storing the result in a variable. This action updates data in a specified datastore table and stores the result in a variable for further use.

### 37. **Delete Variable value**
The action is for **deleting the value of a variable** by setting it to null. It sets the value of a specific variable to **null**, effectively deleting or resetting its value.   
**Example**
In the example provided, a variable named **abcd** is set to **null** to remove its current value.  
**Data**
- **abcd**: The variable that is being deleted (set to null). It is an element parameter.
- **Save Variable**: A common action named "save" that is used to confirm or store this change (the nullification of the variable).  
**Summary**
The action resets the value of the **abcd** variable to null, effectively deleting the data stored in it. After this, the change is saved using a common action to confirm the nullification.

### 38. **Disable Showing Value**
This action is designed to save the names of variables whose values should be hidden or masked in the logs. When this action is executed, any variable specified will have its value concealed in the log output, enhancing security by preventing sensitive data from being exposed during logging.

### 39. **Download File using FTP**
This action enables the downloading of a file using FTP with appropriate credentials. The user must provide the FTP server address, along with the FTP username and password, to access the file location. Additionally, the file path on the FTP server must be specified so that ZeuZ knows which file to download. The user is then required to specify the local file path where the file should be saved. If no local path is provided, the file will be downloaded to the root directory commonly `C:\` for Windows or **home** for Ubuntu/macOS.

### 40. **Extract Tabular Data from PDF**
This action allows you to extract tabular data from a single table within a PDF. You can also specify additional parameters to make the extraction more precise, such as the page number from which the table should be extracted. If multiple tables are present, you can select the desired table by using an index starting from 0. Additionally, filters can be applied to narrow the search, and you can specify particular rows and columns to retrieve specific data.

### 41. **Extract Text from PDF**
This action lets you extract specific text/string from a PDF file. You can specify the page number where you want to conduct the extraction. You can also use regular expressions to extract a pattern of text/string.

### 42. **File - Compare using disk file**
This action will allow you to compare two files. You can provide the files as attachments or you can provide the locations of the files in disk.

### 43. **File - Compare using file attachment**
This action will allow you to compare two files. You can provide the files as attachments or you can provide the location of the files in disk. This particular action will allow you to provide the `ini` files as an attachment.

### 44. **File - Copy using disk file**
The action allows users to copy a file within a file system by specifying its disk location. This process duplicates an existing file, enabling users to maintain a copy in a different location while preserving the original. By providing the exact path of the source file, the system can efficiently locate and duplicate it. This action is particularly useful for organizing files, backing up data, or editing a duplicate without affecting the original, thereby enhancing overall file management.

### 45. **File - Copy using file attachment**
This action enables users to copy a file by attaching the file directly along with the step data. By allowing the attachment of the desired file, the process becomes more user-friendly and efficient, eliminating the need to specify the file's path manually. This functionality simplifies the duplication process, ensuring that users can easily retain the original file while creating a copy.

### 46. **File - Create**
The action allows users to create a new file in a file system using the **create** action. To execute this action, users must specify the disk location where the new file should be generated, including the directory path and desired file name. This functionality is crucial for effective file management, as it enables users to organize their data and create various types of documents or scripts directly in the intended location.

### 47. **File - Download and unzip**
This action involves downloading a file from a specified URL and extracting its contents to a designated folder on the user's local system. Initially, the file is retrieved via an HTTP request, typically using programming languages, such as Python or JavaScript. Once downloaded, the file, often in a compressed format (e.g., zip), is unzipped using libraries designed for this purpose, like Python's `zipfile` module. Users can specify the extraction location, allowing for organized file management. This process streamlines operations, making it particularly useful in software development and data analysis by automating the handling of compressed files.

### 48. **File - Download using URL**
This action allows users to download a file from a specified URL and save it to their local disk. The absolute path to the downloaded file is stored in a variable named `file_path`. Users can optionally specify the save location, either as an absolute path or a relative path using the tlide symbol (~) to indicate the user's home directory. If no location is provided, the file will default to being saved in the `~/Downloads` folder.

### 49. **File - Find**
This action assists users in locating a specific file or folder on their local disk. By providing the file or folder's location, users can efficiently search for and identify the desired item within the filesystem.

### 50. **File - Move**
The **move** action enables users to relocate a file from its current disk location to a new specified location. To perform this operation, users must provide two key pieces of information: the source location, which is the current path of the file to be moved, and the destination location, which indicates where the file should be placed after the move. By executing this action, the file is transferred from the source to the destination, facilitating better organization and management of files within the filesystem.

### 51. **File - Rename (using disk file)**
The **rename** action enables users to change the name of a file on their disk. To perform this operation, users must provide the current file location, which identifies the exact path of the file, and the new file name that the file should take after the action is executed. This renaming process keeps the file in its original location while updating its name, enhancing file organization and making it easier to identify and manage files within the filesystem.

### 52. **File - Unzip**
The **unzip** action allows users to extract the contents of a compressed file to a specified destination path on their disk. To perform this action, users must provide the location of the compressed file (e.g., .zip or .tar.gz) that they wish to unzip, ensuring the system can locate it. Additionally, users can specify a destination path where the unzipped contents will be stored, facilitating organized file management. Upon execution, the contents of the compressed file are extracted to the chosen destination, making them readily accessible for use and enabling efficient retrieval of archieved files.

### 53. **File - Unzip file using attachment**
This action allows users to unzip a compressed file provided as an attachment and extract its contents to a specified destination on their disk. The user attaches a zip file and specifies a destination path where the unzipped contents will be stored. Upon execution, the contents are extracted and placed in the designated folder, making the files easily accessible and organized.

### 54. **File - Upload file to log uploader**
This action allows users to upload a file to the ZeuZ Log Uploader by specifying the file's location on their disk. Users provide the exact disk path of the file they wish to upload, ensuring the system can locate it for the upload process. Once the action is executed, the file is transferred to the ZeuZ platform, where it can be used for logging, tracking, or analysis purposes. This action streamlines the process of uploading files to ZeuZ, making it efficient for handling log data or other relevant files.

### 55. **File - Zip**
This action enables users to compress a file into a zip format and save it to a specified destination on their disk. To perform this action, users must provide the disk location of the file they wish to zip, ensuring the system knows where to locate the file. Additionally, they can specify the destination path where the newly created zip file will be saved. This action helps in reducing file size and organizing multiple files into a single compressed archive for easier storage or sharing.

### 56. **Folder - Copy**
This action allows users to copy a file from one location to another on their disk. By providing the source file's disk location and specifying the destination path, the system duplicates the file while keeping the original intact. The copied file is then placed in the designated destination. This action is useful for creating backups, duplicating files, or transferring files between different directories.

### 57. **Folder - Count no of files in a folder**
This action counts the total number of files within a specified folder, including all files located in its subfolders. Users provide the disk location of the folder they wish to analyze. The action then aggregates all files within that folder and its subdirectories. The result, which is the total file count, is stored in a shared variable named "noOfFiles". This action is useful for quickly determining the total number of files in a directory structure, including all nested files.

### 58. **Folder - Create**
The **create** action allows users to create a new folder at a specified disk location. To perform this action, users must provide the desired path where the folder should be created. Once executed, the system generates a new folder at the specified location. This action is useful for organizing files and directories, enabling users to structure their data more effectively by creating folders in their preferred locations.

### 59. **Folder - Empty Trash**
This action enables users to clear the trash can on Linux or Mac operating systems, permanently deleting all files and folders stored in the trash. By executing this action, the system empties the trash, freeing up disk space and ensuring that the deleted items can no longer be recovered. This is particularly useful for maintaining disk cleanliness and managing storage effectively.

### 60. **Folder - Find**
The action of locating a file or folder involves using a search tool in an operating system. Users can specify a location on the disk, such as drive or folder, to enhance accuracy. By entering the file or folder name, they initiate a search that scans the specified area and displays relevant results. This method improves efficiency and accuracy, allowing quick access to essential documents.

### 61. **Folder - Get home directory**
This action retrieves the location of the current home directory, where a user stores personal files and settings, and saves it in a shared variable called **home_directory**. This allows for easy access in subsequent actions within the program, enhancing efficiency and consistency by ensuring that the same reference is used throughout the script. Such functionality is especially beneficial in scripting and automation tasks that require frequent access to user-specific files and configurations.

### 62. **Folder - Move**
The **move** action enables users to transfer a folder from its current location to a specified target directory within the file system by providing both the original and new paths, facilitating better organization and management of files.

### 63. **Folder - Rename**
The **rename** action allows users to change a folder's name within a computer's file system by specifying its current disk location and providing a new name. Once both the location and new name are specified, the system updates the folder's name accordingly.

### 64. **Folder - Structure**
This action involves generating a comprehensive list of all sub-folders and files within a specified directory and displaying them in a hierarchial tree format. It begins by traversing the directory and its subdirectories to retrieve the names of all contained files and folders, organizing this data into a tree structure that visually represents their relationships. The final output is printed to the console or user interface, allowing users to easily understand the organization of the directory.

### 65. **Folder - Unzip**
This action involves unzipping or extracting the contents of a `.zip` file to a specified destination directory. It begins by identifying the source `.zip` file through its complete filepath and designating the destination directory where the extracted contents will be placed. Once both paths are provided, the system executes the unzip action, reading the compressed contents and preserving the original directory structure as they are extracted.

### 66. **Folder - Zip**
Zipping a folder involves compressing its contents into a single archive file, usually with a `.zip` extension, which reduces the overall file size. This process starts with selecting the folder, followed by initiating the zipping action often through a right-click in a file explorer and specifying a destination for the compressed file. The benefits of zipping include saving storage space, simplifying file sharing, and maintaining the original file structure.

### 67. **Get All Server Variables**
To retrieve a global variable saved on the server within a test management tool, one must first identify the variable's name set by another test case under the same run ID. Next, establish a connection to the server and use the appropriate method, such as an API call or a specific library function, to access the variable. After making the request, handle the response by parsing the data and checking for errors. Once obtained, the value can be utilized in the current test case for assertions or other operations.

### 68. **Get Server Variable**
Running multiple test cases simultaneously is efficiently managed through linked test cases, which connect to a master test case. When the master test case is executed with the "Run linked test cases" option selected, all linked tests run concurrently. To facilitate data sharing, server variables are accessible to all linked tests and the master test case after initialization. These variables can be retrieved using the "get server variable" action; however, if not initialized, they will cause the current test case to fail. Additionally, there is an option to wait for a server variable to be initialized, enhancing the robustness and interconnectivity of the testing process.

### 69. **Get Server Variable and Wait**
The action to retrieve server variables allows users to obtain multiple server variables simultaneously, streamlining the process of accessing shared data within linked test cases. By specifying a list of variable names in a single request, testers can reduce overhead and enhance efficiency. Upon execution, the server processes the request and returns the specified variables in a structured format, making them easy to access. If any requested variables are not initialized, the action provides feedback on their availability, which is crucial for ensuring test case reliability.

### 70. **Get current desktop path**
The action to retrieve the current desktop folder path dynamically fetches the specific file path for the user executing the tests and saves it in a shared variable called "Desktop". This allows easy access for other test cases or actions needing to reference the desktop location. By eliminating hard-coded paths, which can vary across user accounts, this action enhances workflow efficiency and simplifies file management in test automation, making interactions with desktop files more straightforward.

### 71. **Get current username of OS**
The action to retrieve the operating system's username dynamically fetches the name of the user currently logged into the system where the test is running. This username can be stored in a variable for use in various test scenarios, such as logging, validation, or user-specific workflows. The action is compatible across different operating systems, making tests environment-aware and eliminating the need for manual input.

### 72. **Get global variable**
The action to retrieve or create a global list variable allows access to a global value shared across test cases, regardless of the run session. If the specified global list variable exists on the server, it is retrieved; if not, the action returns an empty list, enabling dynamic initialization. Once set, the global list variable remains stored on the server until removed, making it accessible for all test cases at any time. This ensures persistence, consistency, and reusability across test executions, streamlining the management of shared data for various test scenarios.

### 73. **Get path of current documents**
The action retrieves the current user's "Documents" folder path and saves it in the shared variable "Documents". This allows test cases to dynamically access the folder location without needing hardcoded paths. Once stored, the path can be reused across multiple test cases during the session for tasks like reading or writing files. This action works across different operating systems and simplifies file management in test automation by providing easy access to the "Documents" folder.

### 74. **Get the path of attached file**
This action retrieves the file path of a file attached to a test step and saves it in a shared variable, making it accessible for use by other test cases or steps within the same session. By automatically capturing and storing the file path, this action streamlines file management, allowing test cases to easily reference or manipulate the file without manual input. It enhances automation by ensuring consistent access to the attached file throughout the test execution.

### 75. **INI file - Add a line (using disk location)**
This action allows users to modify an `.ini` configuration file by specifying its exact disk location. The file is updated by appending or modifying a line with the desired settings. It ensures that changes are made and saved correctly, providing direct file access without needing uploads. This simplifies configuration updates during testing, enhancing flexibility and efficiency in managing settings stored in `.ini` files.

### 76. **INI file - Add a line (using file attachment)**
This action enables users to add a line to an `.ini` file, which is a configuration file used to store settings. Users have two options for providing the `.ini` file: they can specify its disk location or attach the file directly. When choosing to attach file, the action processes the provided `.ini` file, allowing for the insertion of new configuration details. This flexibility facilitates easier updates and modifications to configuration settings, making it particularly useful in various automation and testing scenarios.

### 77. **INI file - Bypass action Add a line**
This action enhances error handling within a test case by executing a specified bypass action whenever a failure occurs. Defined at the beginning of the test case, the bypass action is triggered if the original action fails, such as, when unable to add a line to an `.ini` file. If the bypass action succeeds, it allows for a retry of the original action. This mechanism streamlines error recovery, minimizes disruptions from temporary failures, and improves the overall efficiency of the testing process.

### 78. **INI file - Change line value (using disk location)**
This action allows users to add a line to an `.ini` file by specifying its disk location, providing the exact file path where the file is stored on the system. By directly modifying the specified `.ini` file, the action appends or updates a line with the necessary configuration details. This approach streamlines the management of configuration settings, enabling efficient updates without requiring file uploads or attachments, and enhances the flexibility of configuration management.

### 79. **INI file - Change line value (using file attachment)**
This action allows users to add a line to an `.ini` file by providing the file as an attachment rather than specifying a disk location. By uploading the `.ini` file directly, users can easily insert new configuration details. This approach simplifies the process of updating configuration settings, making it convenient for those without access to the file path or who prefer direct uploads. Overall, this action enhances flexibility in managing `.ini` files and facilitates easier modifications.

### 80. **INI file - Delete a line (using disk location)**
This action enables users to delete a line from an `.ini` file by specifying its disk location, requiring the exact file path where the file stored on the system. By using this action, users can identify and remove the specified line within the `.ini` file, streamlining the management of configuration settings. This functionality is particularly useful for eliminating outdated or unneccessary configurations, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency of the configuration management process.

### 81. **INI file - Delete a line (using file attachment)**
This action allows users to delete a specific line from an **INI** file, a simple text-based format used for application configuration settings. Users can attach the **INI** file for precise modifications, ensuring the correct file is accessed. It is essential to specify the exact line to avoid losing important information. Creating a backup before making changes is recommended to maintain the integrity of the configuration and to validate that the application continues to function properly after the deletion.

### 82. **INI file - Read name and value**
This action enables users to read key-value pairs from an **INI** file, a format commonly used for configuration settings. The extracted names and values are stored in a shared variable named `dic_name`, allowing for easy access and manipulation. This feature is useful for applications that require dynamic access to configuration settings without manual parsing. Users should ensure the **INI** file is well-formed and accessible, and confirm that the variable name does not conflict with existing ones to avoid errors.

### 83. **Image compare**
The action of comparing two images, A and B, assesses their similarity by generating a score between 0.0 (0% similarity) and 1.0 (100% similarity). A score of 0.75 indicates the images are at least 75% similar. Users can provide either the full path to the images or reference them as attachments using a specific format, such as `%|a.png|%`, allowing ZeuZ to automatically retrieve and compare the images. This automated process is valuable in quality assurance, ensuring efficient and objective evaluation of visual elements within software applications.

### 84. **Log error**
The action of adding error notifications to a log through sequential actions is essential for effective error handling in software testing. This process involves checking for errors after each test step, and if an error is detected, logging a notification that includes key details such as the timestamp, error type, and contextual information. By automating this logging, errors are consistently tracked, enabling quick identification and resolution of issues, ultimately enhancing the quality and reliability of the software.

### 85. **Log warning**
The action of adding warnings to a log using sequential actions is crucial for monitoring software quality during testing. This process involves executing test steps and checking for conditions that may indicate potential issues, leading to the logging of warnings. Each warning includes essential details such as the timestamp, warning type, and relevant contextual information. By automating this logging, warnings are systematically recorded without manual intervention, enabling teams to address them promptly.

### 86. **Parse and Modify date time**
The action of parsing and modifying date and time from a string allows users to extract and manipulate specific components such as years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds. Users can add or subtract time by specifying optional parameters, such as `hours | optional parameter | +2` to add 2 hours   
or `hours | optional parameter | -2` to subtract 2 hours. It is essential to define the current format of the provided date-time string, as well as an optional target format for conversion. 
A common format might be `%Y-%m-%d`, which users can customize with different seperators or spacing.

### 87. **Read Text File**
The action allows users to extract text from various file formats, such as `.txt`, `.pdf`, and `.json`, and store it in a specified variable within the ZeuZ environment. Users provide the file path, which can be a relative or absolute path, and use the `read text file` common action to save the content as a string in a variable. If the content needs to be saved as JSON, an optional parameter called `read as json` must be included, allowing the user to specify that the content should be treated as a JSON object. This functionality enhances data handling in automation workflows, making it easier to manipulate and utilize text data.

### 88. **Read from YAML file**
This action reads data from a YAML file and saves it in a variable as a list-dict format. Users can specify the file path directly, for example, `c:\Users\ASUS\Downloads\devices.yaml`, or upload the file as an attachment, referencing it with `%| |%` symbols, like `%|devices.yaml|%`. Additionally, users can use the tlide (`~`) to reference the home directory for universal compatibility, such as `~/Desktop/demo.yaml`. The YAML data is then stored in the variable for easy manipulation in automation workflows.

### 89. **Read from a CSV file**
This action reads data from a CSV file and saves it in a variable as a list of dictionaries. Users can provide the CSV file path directly (e.g., `c\Users\ASUS\Downloads\devices.csv`), upload it as an attachment using `%| |%`, or reference the home directory with `~` (e.g., `~/Desktop/demo.csv`). The **delimeter** specifies how values are seperated (e.g., comma, semicolon, tab). The data is structured as a "list of dictionaries", where the first row serves as the key and subsequent rows as values for easy manipulation in automation workflows.

### 90. **Remove / Delete global variable**
This action removes a global variable that is stored on the server. Global variables are shared across different workflows and environments within the system, and deleting them ensures they are no longer accessible in any automation processes. By executing this action, users can clean up unnecessary or outdated global variables.

### 91. **Replace String**
This action allows users to replace or remove specific characters or substrings within a main string. The user provides the **source** string, identifies the **find** substring to be removed, and specifies a **replace with** substring. If left empty, the found substring will be removed. For example, given the string `%|paragraph|% = "John is 5 years old. John started going to school"`, replacing "John" with "Mike" results in `%|new_paragraph|% = "Mike is 5 years old. Mike started going to school"`. This action is useful for modifying strings dynamically in automation workflows.

### 92. **Run Macro in Excel**
This action runs a macro in an Excel file based on the provided file path and macro name. Users specify the **Excel file path** where the macro is stored and the **macro name** to be executed. Once triggered, the macro performs the predefined tasks within the Excel file, automating processes such as repetitive tasks or complex calculations.

### 93. **Run or Execute command**
This action enables users to execute any arbitrary commands or programs on their system. The result of the command is returned in a structured format, containing the **return code** (indicating success or failure) and the output (the result of the executed command). Users can also run multiple commands in sequence and specify how the commands are seperated. This action is useful for automating system-level tasks or executing scripts directly within an automation workflow.

### 94. **Save time**
This action captures the current time and stores it in a shared variable named **time**. This allows users to reference and use the saved time later for comparisons or other time-based operations within workflows. It is helpful for tracking when specific action occur, enabling accurate time comparisons or validations in future steps of an automation process.

### 95. **Search and save text**
This action performs a search on a given text to find matches based on a specified pattern and saves the results in a variable. If multiple matches are found, they can be accessed using indexing, like `%|save[x]|%`. For instance, searching for "hello" in the text "hello there, how are you?" will save "hello" in the variable. Users can also use regular expressions, like `"\d+[-]?\d+"`, to extract numbers from a text. For example, searching `"Hello 67890 none 9030-49"` will return `'67890'` and `'9030-49'`, both saved as strings. Further actions can convert these results into other formats like integers.

### 96. **Set Server Variable**
The "Set Server Variable" action initializes a variable that can be shared across a test case and its linked test cases during execution, enabling seamless data sharing. Once set, the server variable remains active until all linked test cases are completed, allowing dynamic coordination between them. However, if the variable is set at a specific step, it will only become accessible to other linked test cases after after that step is fully executed This ensures the variable is available on after its initialization is complete.

### 97. **Set global variable**
Setting a global variable allows users to create a variable stored on the **ZeuZ** server, making it accessible to multiple test cases running under the same Run ID. This action facilitates data sharing among tests, enabling them to fetch and utilize the global variable during execution. It is particularly useful for maintaining consistency in common data, such as configuration settings or results from previous tests, thereby enhancing the efficiency and coordination of automated testing workflows.

### 98. **Set sleep globally after or before any action**
The **Sleep Setting** action allows users to define wait times before or after specific interactions in a test case, accommodating slow website performance. This action ensures that test steps have sufficient time to execute by introducing consistent delays. For example, a user can set a 2.5-second delay after every web action by adding a row with `web | post sleep | 2.5`, or introduce a 1.5-second delay both before and after all windows actions by using `windows | pre post sleep | 1.5`. Overall, this action helps facilitate smoother test execution by managing the timing of interactions.

### 99. **Skip Test Cases**
The **Skip Test Cases** action allows users to bypass the execution of specific test cases within the same run, marking their status as "skipped". This action is useful when certain tests are not relevant to the current execution context, such as when prerequisites are unmet. By selectively skipping test cases, users can focus on more relevant tests while maintaining a clear record of those not executed. 

### 100. **Split string**
The **Split String** action allows users to divide a given string into multiple components based on a specified seperator or expression. This action stores the results in a variable as a list, enabling users to parse data or handle formatted input effectively. After splitting the string, individual items can be accessed using a specific syntax, such as `%|variableName[0]|%` to retrieve the first item.

### 101. **Start Timer**
The **Timer Action** manages the timing of test case execution using specified values. A value of '5' indicates that the timer will start after a delay of 5 seconds, meaning the action will trigger once this period has elapsed. Conversely, a negative value, such as '-5', signifies that the timer started 5 seconds ago, accounting for the elapsed time. This action is useful for synchronizing events in testing scenarios, allowing for precise delays and tracking the duration since a specific action was initiated.

### 102. **Take Screenshot**
The **Take Screenshot** action allows users to capture an image of the current application or webpage during test execution. This action helps document the state of the application at specific points, which is useful for debugging, validating test results, or tracking test progress. The captured screenshot is stored as part of the test results and can be reviewed for analysis or reporting.

### 103. **Testcase Exit**
The **Testcase Exit** action allows users to immediately stop a test case and set its status to "passed", "failed", or "skipped" based on the user's choice. This action is useful when execution needs to stop prematurely due to errors or when certain conditions are met, ensuring control over the final outcome even if all test steps are not completed. It provides flexibility in managing unexpected situations and determining test results.

### 104. **Validate Schema**
It validates a given JSON/Python data object against the expected JSON schema. If compare fails, it will exit the steps with Fail. However, in some cases, we may have a dynamic JSON output from a REST, DB or other types of action. This action can be used to validate the structure/schema of the output of our call. We can either do a partial match or exact match.

### 105. **Validate order**
This action verifies whether a given list of numbers or strings is in the correct order. Users provide a simple list, and the action checks if the elements are arranged sequentially, either in ascending or descending order. If the list is not sorted as expected, the test will fail. This action is useful for validating the order of data within test cases.

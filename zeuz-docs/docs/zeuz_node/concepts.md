It involves converting human-readable instructions and logic into a format that a computer can understand and execute. It is essential for creating software applications, websites, and various digital solutions.

### Component

**Component** typically refers to a modular and independent part of a software application or system. Components are tested individually to ensure they perform their specific functions correctly before being integrated into the larger software system for further testing.

### Application Programming Interface (API)

**Application Programming Interface (API)** is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. It defines the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information, enabling the integration of diverse software systems and services.  
APIs are fundamental in modern software development, facilitating the development of software components, web services, and the interaction between applications, platforms, and devices.

### Automated Software Quality (ASQ)

**Automated Software Quality (ASQ)** refers to the use of automated tools, processes, and techniques to assess and ensure the quality of software throughout its development lifecycle. This includes automating various testing activities such as functional testing, regression testiong, performance testing, and more.

### Independent Test Group (ITG)

An **Independent Test Group (ITG)** is a dedicated team or unit within a software development or testing organization that is responsible for conducting testing activities autonomously and seperately from the development team. Their primary focus is to assess the quality of the software product objectively, identify defects, and ensure that the software meets its specified requirements and quality standards.  
Independent Test Groups (ITG) are often used to maintain an impartial perspective and provide unbiased feedback on the software's readiness for release. They may perform various types of testing, including functional, regression, performance, and security testing, among others.

### Debugging

**Debugging** is the process of identifying, isolating, and fixing errors or defects in software code to ensure that a program functions correctly and as intended.  
Debugging techniques may include analyzing code, setting breakpoints, inspecting variables, and using debugging tools to pinpoint and rectify problems in the code.

### Emulator

An **Emulator** is a software or hardware-based tool that replicates the functionality of one computing environment ( such as hardware platform or operating system ) on another.  
Emulators are commonly used in software development and testing to simulate the behavior of specific hardware or software environments.

### Code Coverage

**Code Coverage** measures how much of the code is executed by test cases, helping assess testing comprehensiveness.

### Inspection

**Inspection** is a systematic review process where a team of experts, including testers, developers, or domain specialists, thoroughly examines software and its documentation. The aim is to uncover defects, errors, or improvements needed in the software.  
**Inspections** help detect issues early, ensure quality, improve documentation, enhance communication among team members, and prevent problems down the line. This structured and formal process is vital for maintaining software quality, particularly in critical applications, and plays a crucial role in the software development and testing lifecycle.

### Code Inspection

**Code Inspection**, also know as *code review*, is a systematic examination of source code by software developers to find and fix defects, improve code quality, and ensure adherence to coding standards and design guidelines. It is a manual and collaborative process that helps identify issues early in the development cycle, leading to higher software reliability and maintainability.

### Metric

A **Metric** is a measurable quantity or indicator that provides insight into the quality, efficiency, or effectiveness of the testing process. These metrics help assess various aspects of testing, such as, test coverage, defect density, test execution time, and more, to make data-driven decisions and improvements in the testing process.

### Release Candidate

A **Release Candidate** (often abbreviated as "RC") is a version of a software product that is in the final stages of testing and is close to being released to the public as the official, stable version.  
**Release Candidates** are considered feature-complete and go through rigorous testing to identify and fix any critical issues, bugs, or showstopper problems. If no significant issues are discovered during this testing phase, the release candidate become the official release.

## Black Box Testing Definition and Techniques

### Definition:

**Black Box Testing** is a method where the internal structure and logic of the system are not known to the tester, focusing solely on input and output behavior. It is the type of testing in which an application is tested based on its requirements specifications without the need for knowledge of its internal architecture.

### Techniques:

Most common types of *Black Box Testing* techniques are mentioned in the followings:

* ### Equivalence Class Partitioning

  **Equivalence Class Partitioning** is a black box testing technique that involves dividing the input data into different equivalence classes to ensure thorough test coverage. The idea is to group similar sets of inputs that are likely to exhibit similar behavior, allowing testers to design test cases that represent each class. By testing a representative from each equivalence class, it becomes possible to detect defects that might occur within that class. This technique is especially useful when dealing with large sets of input data, as it helps streamline the testing process by focusing on representative cases rather than exhaustive testing of every possible input combination.

* ### Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)

  **Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)** is a black box testing technique used to identify defects or issues at the boundaries of input domains. It focuses on testing values that are at the edges or just outside the valid ranges for input data. In this technique, it analyze the behavior of the application with test data residing at the boundaries of the equivalence classes.  

  For example, if a software component accepts integers between 1 and 100, a boundary value analysis would involve testing values such as:  
  * **1 (The *Lower* Boundary)**
  * **100 (The *Upper* Boundary)**
  * **2 (Just inside the *Lower* Boundary)**
  * **99 (Just inside the *Upper* Boundary)**
  * **0 (Just outside the *Lower* Boundary)**
  * **101 (Just outside the *Upper* Boundary)**.  


* ### Decision Tables

  **Decision Tables** provide a structured method for representing complex logical conditions and business rules. They serve to document various combinations of inputs and their corresponding outcomes or actions. Comprising rows and columns, each row denotes a unique input combination, and each column represents a condition or action. This format facilitates a clear visualization of scenarios, aiding testers in ensuring the software behaves as intended under different conditions.  
Decision tables are particularly valuable for testing systems with intricate decision-making logic and multiple inputs.

* ### Cause Effect Graph

  **Cause Effect Graph** is a graphical representation used to depict the logical relationships between inputs (causes) and output (effects) in a system. It is technique commonly used in test case design to systematically generate test cases based on the various combinations of input conditions.

* ### State Transition Testing

  **State Transition Testing** focuses on the transitions between different states of a system based on specific inputs. It is particularly useful for systems with discrete states, like those controlled by finite state machines. Test cases are designed to verify accurate state transitions, revealing potential defects and ensuring the software behaves as intended as it moves through different states. This method is valuable for uncovering issues related to state-dependent behavior, providing comprehensive test coverage in scenarios where the system's actions are influenced by its current state.

* ### Use Case Testing

  **Use Case** is a detailed description of how a system interacts with an external entity to achieve a specific goal. These descriptions provide a clear understanding of how the system is intended to operate from the user's perspective, aiding developers, testers, and other team members in aligning their efforts with the project's goals.

  However, **Use Case Testing** is a software testing technique that centers around validating the functionality of a system based on its specified use cases. A use case represents a specific interaction between the system and an external entity, typically a user or another system. In use case testing, test cases are designed to simulate these interactions to ensure that the system behaves as expected and meet the requirements outlined in the use cases. This approach is particularly effective for testing the end-to-end functionality of a system, as it focuses on real-world scenarios and user interactions.  
  **User Case Testing** helps identify issues related to the flow of events, inputs, and expected outcomes specified in the use cases, contributing to the overall quality assurance of the software.

## White Box Testing Definition and Techniques

### Definition:

**White Box Testing** that examines the internal structure, logic, and code of a software application. Also known as clear-box testing, structural testing, or glass-box testing, it involves testing the internal workings of the software to ensure that all code paths are executed and that the application functions as intended. Testers, often with knowledge of the internal code, design test cases based on the application's internal logic to verify the accuracy of calculations, input validation, and other aspects of the code. White-box testing is instrumental in identifying issues related to code quality, security vulnerabilities, and ensuring comprehensive test coverage at the code level.

### Techniques:

Different types of *White-Box Testing* techniques are given below:

* ### Statement Coverage
  
  **Statement Coverage** is a metric used in *White-Box Testing* to measure the percentage of executable statements in a program that have been exercised by a set of test cases. It assesses how well the source code has been tested by determining the proportion of statements that were executed at least once during testing. The goal of *Statement Coverage* is to ensure that all code statements have been tested to identify potential bugs or errors.  
  Since the *Statement Coverage* determines the percentage of the source code a specific set of test cases exercises, the formula for *Statement Coverage* is:

  **Statement Coverage = (Number of Statements Executed / Total Number of Statements)*100**.

* ### Branch Coverage

  **Branch Coverage** is a white-box testing metric that assesses the proportion of branches *(Decision points)* in a software program that have been executed by a set of test cases. In branch coverage, a branch refers to a decision point in the code, such as, an *if* statement or loop. The goal is to ensure that each possible branch of the code is executed at least once during testing.  
  **Branch Coverage** helps identify untested decision outcomes and increases the likelihood of detecting errors related to different logical paths in the code.  
  Since *Branch Coverage* implies the percentage of branches or decision points executed during testing, the formula for *Branch Coverage* is:

  **Branch Coverage = (Number of executed branches / Total number of branches)*100%**.

* ### Condition Coverage

  **Condition Coverage** is a white-box testing metric that evaluates the proportion of logical conditions in a software program that have been exercised by a set of test cases. It focuses on testing the various Boolean conditions within the code, such as those found in *if* statements or loops. The objective is to ensure that each condition in the program has been evaluated as both true and false during testing, aiming to cover all possible outcomes.  
  **Condition Coverage** provides a more detailed analysis than statement or branch coverage by specifically addressing the logical conditions within the code. This metric helps enhance the thoroughness of testing, particularly in scenarios where different conditions may impact the program's behavior.

* ### Multiple Condition Testing
  
  **Multiple Condition Testing** is a white-box testing technique that aims to assess the different combinations of logical conditions within a software program. It involves designing test cases to cover various combinations of Boolean conditions, ensuring that each possible permutation is tested. This technique is particularly useful in scenarios where the behavior of the software depends on the interaction of multiple conditions. By systematically, testing different combinations, multiple condition testing helps identify potential issues related to the logical flow and decision-making processes in the code.

:::note
  Let's consider a basic example in a python program where we want to test multiple conditions:

  **def evaluate_conditions(x, y):  
    **if x > 0 and y > 0:  
        return "Both positive"  
    elif x < 0 and y < 0:  
        return "Both negative"  
    elif x > 0 and y < 0:  
        return "X positive, Y negative"  
    elif x < 0 and y > 0:  
        return "X negative, Y positive"  
    else:  
        return "Other cases"

* **Test cases for multiple condition testing**  
  print(evaluate_conditions(2, 3))   
  **Expected: "Both positive"**     
  print(evaluate_conditions(-2, -3))  
  **Expected: "Both negative"**    
  print(evaluate_conditions(5, -3))   
  **Expected: "X positive, Y negative"**    
  print(evaluate_conditions(-5, 3))   
  **Expected: "X negative, Y positive"**    
  print(evaluate_conditions(0, 0))    
  **Expected: "Other cases"**
:::

  In this example, **evaluate_conditions** function has multiple conditions based on the values of **x** and **y**. The test cases cover various scenarios, such as *both positive*, *both negative*, *X positive*, *Y negative*, *X negative*, *Y positive* and *other cases*. This simple example demonstrates the concept of multiple condition testing by systematically testing different combinations to ensure comprehensive coverage of the code logic.

* ### Path Testing

  **Path Testing** is a white-box testing technique that systematically evaluates various paths or routes through a program's source code. It involves viewing the program as a control flow graph and designing test cases to cover different paths through this graph, including both feasible and infeasible paths. The objectives include identifying and testing each feasible path, ensuring coverage of loops and conditional statements under different conditions, and detecting potential logic errors in the program's control flow. Path testing can be complex, especially in programs with loops and conditional statements, and often employs tools like control flow graphs and cyclomatic complexity to guide the testing process.

* ### Loop Testing

  **Loop Testing** is a white-box testing technique specifically designed to assess the behavior of loops within a program. This method focuses on ensuring the correctness of loop initialization, maintenance, and termination under various conditions. Key aspects include testing within the loop body, examining behavior at loop boundaries, assessing scenarios with zero and one iteration, and detecting potential errors associated with loop control variables. Loop testing is vital for identifying and preventing issues related to loops, such as infinite loops or premature exits, and ensuring the robustness of the program's looping constructs.

## Types of Testing:

### Boundary Testing

The goal is to ensure that the software functions as intended and is ready for deployment and actual use.

### Alpha Testing

**Alpha Testing** is a form of *Acceptance Testing* conducted by the internal development team or a select group of testers before the software's release to external users. This testing occurs in a controlled environment, often the development or testing environment, and aims to identify and resolve issues before a wider user audience is exposed to the software. The testing team, typically consisting of internal employees, focuses on uncovering bugs, assessing overall functionality, and ensuring the software meets specified requirements.  
**Alpha Testing** covers the entire software system, and feedback from this phase is valuable for refining and improving the software's stability before it advances to beta testing and reaches external users.

### Accessibility Testing

**Accessibility Testing** is the process of evaluating a software application or system to ensure that it is accessible and usable by individuals with disabilities, including those with visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive impairments, in accordance with accessibility standards and guidelines.

### Ad Hoc Testing

**Ad Hoc Testing** is an informal and spontaneous approach to software testing. In this method, testers do not follow predefined test cases or structured test plans. Instead, they explore the software system in an unscripted manner, looking for defects, issues, or unexpected behaviors. It relies on the tester's intuition and creativity to discover issues, making it a valuable but unstructured testing approach.

### Agile Testing

**Agile Testing** is a software testing approach that aligns with the principles and practices of Agile software development. It involves testing and quality assurance activities performed in parallel with the development process, emphasizing collaboration, flexibility, and continuous feedback.

The goal is to ensure that the software is free from defects under all potential scenarios.   
Exhaustive testing is rarely used in practice, and testers typically employ their testing methods, such as equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis, to focus on critical and representative test cases.

### Functional Testing

**Functional Testing** is a critical aspect of software testing, focusing on evaluating whether a software application meets its intended functionality. This type of testing involves testing the software's features, inputs, outputs, and behavior based on predefined requirements. Testers use valid and invalid inputs to check how the software responds and verify that all features work correctly.

### Grey Box Testing

**Grey Box Testing** is a hybrid software testing method that combines elements of both black box and white box testing. Testers conducting grey box tests have limited knowledge of the software's internal workings, such as its code structure, but not full access to the source code. They use this partial understanding to design test cases that evaluate the software's functionality, security, and integration points. This approach strikes a balance between the black box method, which lacks insight into the software's architecture, and white box testing, which requires in-depth knowledge of the code.

### Higher Order Testing

**Higher Order Testing** typically refers to a level of software testing that goes beyond the traditional unit, integration, and system testing. It involves testing the interactions and compatibility between different systems, components, or services within a larger software ecosystem.  
Higher order testing may encompass various types of testing, including system integration testing, end-to-end testing, performance testing, and user acceptance testing, to ensure that the entire software system or ecosystem functions as expected.

### Integration Testing

**Integration Testing** is a phase where individual components or units of a software application are combined and tested as a group. The primary goal of integration testing is to ensure that these integrated components work together correctly, communicate effectively, and produce the expected results when combined. This testing phase helps identify any interface or interaction issues between different parts of the software and verifies that data flows smoothly between them. It ensures that the integrated system functions as a whole and meets the specified requirements.

### Installation Testing

## Test Planning and Development:

### Test Case

A **Test Case** is a documented set of conditions or steps used to assess a particular aspect or behavior of a software application. It includes the inputs, the specific execution conditions, and the expected results, serving as a means to verify whether the software functions as expected.

### Test Environment

A **Test Environment** is a controlled setup mirroring real-world conditions used for software testing and development. It includes hardware, software, databases, and configurations to simulate live environments without affecting production. It aims to verify the functionality, performance, and behavior of applications under specific conditions, ensuring accurate results and reproducibility of issues found.

### Test Plan

A **Test Plan** is a collection of presets. Test plan establishes predefined guidelines, procedures, and criteria for conducting tests on software. These settings or guidelines dictate how the testing activities will be performed, what to test, how to test it, and the expected outcomes, providing a standerdized approach for testing a specific software product.

### Test Procedure

A **Test Procedure** is a detailed step-by-step process defining how to execute a particular test case or a set of test cases. It provides specific instructions, conditions, and expected outcomes, allowing testers to perform the tests accurately and consistently, ensuring that the software behaves as intended in various scenarios.

### Test Script

A **Test Script** is a set of instructions or commands written in a scripting language. It defines the sequence of actions to be executed during software testing. These scripts guide the testing tools or automated processes to perform specific interactions, validations, and verifications on the software under test. They detail steps, inputs, expected outcomes, and often utilize testing frameworks or tools to automate test execution. Test scripts are integral to automated testing processes, ensuring consistent and repeatable test scenarios.

### Test Specification

A **Test Specification** refers to a detailed document outlining the specific conditions, criteria, and requirements for executing individual tests within a broader testing framework. It describes the test scenarios, test cases, inputs, expected outputs, and the conditions under which the tests will be conducted. In essence, it serves as a comprehensive guide for testers, precise instructions on how to carry out each test. Think of it as a detailed script that defines the steps, data, and expected outcomes for each individual test to ensure thorough and systematic examination of the software's functionality.

### Total Quality Management (TQM)

**Total Quality Management (TQM)** signifies a comprehensive approach aimed at achieving and maintaining high-quality software. It encompasses principles and practices that involve all stakeholders in the software development process, focusing on continuous improvement, customer satisfaction, and the pursuit of excellence.  
**TQM** involves implementing quality-focused strategies, rigorous testing methodologies, and a culture that prioritizes defect prevention over detection, ensuring that the software meets or exceeds customer expectations while emphasizing continual refinement and enhancement in all aspects of the testing processes.

### Traceability Matrix

**Traceability Matrix** serves as a document within software development and testing that maps the connection between different project components. It specifically links requirements to the respective tests validating those requirements and further to the corresponding software elements. This matrix acts as a tracking tool, ensuring that all requirements are adequately addressed and validated during the development and testing processes. By illustrating these connections, it allows for a comprehensive analysis to confirm that all specified requirements have been properly tested and implemented in the software.

### Software Requirements Specification

**Software Requirements Specification (SRS)** is a comprehensive document that describes in detail the intended functionality, features, and constraints of a software system. It serves as a contract between the software developers and the stakeholders, outlining what the software should should do and how it should perform.  
The **SRS** typically includes information such as, system functionality, performance requirements, design constraints, and user interfaces. It is a fundamental document that guides the design, development, and testing processes to ensure that the final software product meets the specified requirements.

### Validation

**Validation** assesses whether a system meets specified requirements and functions as intended in its operational environment. It occurs during or at the end of the development process, ensuring that the end product aligns with user needs and expectations. Unlike verification, which checks adherence to requirements during development, *validation* focuses on confirming that the final product meets user requirements and performs as intended in real-world scenarios.

### Verification

**Verification** is the process of evaluating each phase of the development cycle to ensure that it adheres to the specified requirements. It involves reviewing and inspecting work products, such as design documents and code, to check for consistency with the initial specifications.  
**Verification** aims to confirm that each development phase follows the predefined guidelines and standards and that the output aligns with the intended objectives. It is distinct from validation, which assesses the final product to confirm that it meets user requirements and performs as intended in its operational environment. Verification is an integral part of the quality assurance process, helping to identify and rectify issues early in the development lifecycle.
